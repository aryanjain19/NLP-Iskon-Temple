"Its a beautiful and amazing place offers a different vibration all together.

Be there for a while and don't speak a word and you can feel astonishing peace. It might take you to cry even. This feeling can not be described in words.",1
This is a famous Lord Krishna temple where you need to take a long queue to complete the darshan and need take more than 1000 stair steps. If you are not well then avoid taking those steps. Photography is not allowed inside the temple premises hence not sharing any photo. A must visit pace in Bangalore,1
It is a nice place and devotional place. The temple was so good with a good spritual representation in Temple brings in devotional feel .,1
"Come here to spend about 2 hours. You get to see this immense building of temple built on a small hill near Mahalakshmi Layout. The nearest metro station is Mahalakshmi Layout and Sandal soap factory metro is also next close one. The temple provides normal entry for free as well as special entry for Rs.300 for a family which comes along with 4 laddu as Prasad and a book worth Rs.70. The route for special Darshan is shortened.
The Darshan means the view of Lord Krishna is just simply fascinating. Lord Krishna is seen with Radha, also seen with Balrama.
It takes about 25 minutes on a weekday to reach Lord Krishna's idol from the start.
After the Darshan there are stalls to buy books, clothes, toys and others that are related to Iskcon and Hare Krishna Hare Ram. Also there are stalls to have variety of good food, snacks and sweets.
Free prashad is provided to all visitors during the exit.
There is also a restaurant located at the base when you exit the top building where you can have meals on table.",1
The temple shrine is very memorable on janmashtmi..I love going here to get peace and happiness..It makes your stress and mind light..,1
"A soothing place to be in!

Avoid visiting on weekends to avoid the looooong queues.",1
"loved the experience and the Dharshan, its exceptional, the ambience, the chanting , the devotion...",1
"A very Nice place to visit.
The temple is r√©cent, but it is richly decorated. The statues are very beautiful. Also, a great place to shop indian items and to eat street food even when you are a European. I recommend visiting this place when you are in Bangalore.",1
"Very large extravagant temple of Lord Krishna.Situated on the main road.Option for special darshan, but required only if temple is crowded otherwise not useful to purchase ticket.",1
"One must visit the temple if, in Bengaluru, very beautiful, vast, superb, magnificent are very few words to describe the experience.",1
"Iskon is very commercial now as I visited with family didn't had feeling of temple, just felt like I went see mall or palace with god.
Last year I took my NRI friend he thought Its a mall.",1
Iskcon is recognised as one of the most famous temple in banglore and many are eager to vist the place every weekend. I love to go with my family and like the slogan..,1
"ISKCON temple is one of those unique temples that has made its name as a must see sightseeing location. If you are religiously or culturally inclined you will find you could spend a lot of time here. Ample parking. The architecture is lovely. Very well run, in an orderly manner, there are three floors that house various deities with elevators that connect the different floors.. Lord Krishna here is beautifully decorated by devout followers. The whole ambience is reverent with the chant of Lord Krishna. We were lucky to have visited on Datta Jayanthi. The decor on that day was indescribably beautiful where the main color was all shades of blue and gold interlaced with peacock feathers. A blessed sight that is unforgettable! ISKCON houses many banquet halls where you can hold private events with prior booking. With various in house restaurants, the food is the best part! Awesome does not describe it! There is even a store that sells all things Krishna to take with you as souvenirs. Go for the temple. Go for the architecture. Go for the food. And don't forget to say Radhe Radhe.",1
Beautiful place to visit. you can have dharshan of all avathar. can leave your chappal in the shed. good prasad. easy drop and pick up facilities. Good hygienic veg restaurant.,1
"You do not need to make a donation to enter the temple, however if you do you get a VIP ticket which saves you from standing many of the long lines.
What I wish I knew before the time:
- No camera's are allowed in, rather leave your camera at the hotel (you can take your cellphone in and there are a few places you are allowed to take pictures).
- No shoes or socks allowed, they do have a place at the entrance where you can leave your shoes for a very small fee, take cash for this.

I am glad we went and overall all it was an interesting experience. Would recommend.",1
very modern temple right in the heart of the city situated on an elevated section.Very well maintained and free prasad too.,1
"Best place to visit if you are in Bangalore
Serene peaceful great hangout place delicious food must visit place in Bangalore great people great learning kitchen with cooks more than 500000 mails daily e must visit to get peace of mind great meditation place gorgeous decoration best meditation centre",1
Peaceful is the best to describe this place. There's a serene energy here which makes you feel so good. Also a restaurant with amazing food. Def worth the visit,1
"The temple is a very nice experience, as others have described. My suggestion is to take the expedited lane, which for 300 rupees, allows you to ""cut"" the main line. In addition to that (potentially significant) advantage, you are given a special chanting experience, discounts on temple literature and a box of 2 take home sweets. Well worth it.",1
"This temple is situated on Chord road, on hilly place with a nice location.Well maintained and managed. Beautiful dieties, peaceful atmosphere.Nice place to pray .",1
"Expect to get jostled, ushered and shoved but all in the spirit of this being India and a sacred site to visit that is very popular. There is a shoe drop-off point nearby the entrance where you have to leave your shoes. You can pay the access fee to the temple by card or cash - if you don't have change for shoe storage, the kind people at the entry might provide you a coin. There's a guided route through the temple and I was occasionally direct a different way by guards and temple employees to avoid the fray and get a quicker walk through - which was great. Parts of this temple are very modern and watching the Hare Krishna sing, dance and pray makes you realise why this is a popular religion. A great experience in Bangalore/Bengaluru!",0
"We love this place it's so divine, mantras makes more positive vibes, we usually visit once in every two months to this place .",1
"Fantastic place to visit
Nice food
Great darshan of the deities
Nice Prasadam and great location at Bangalore",1
This temple is one of the best places to visit in Bangalore. The environment is really very peaceful and welcoming. There's always a large amount of people visiting the temple. The best part that I loved about the temple is that the people there encourages the use of technology and the way they blend technology and traditions together is just beyond explanation. I would like to know others review on this place ones you visit here. It's worth going there. I love this place so much.üòäüòäüòä,1
ISKCON is a must see place to go. It is stunningly beautiful and clean. The ambience is reverent.... Until you are herded out through multiple gift shops. Until that I absolutely would have given a 5 star. So I give 4 stars s being forced to go through a theme park like court. I realize they need to make money but I wish they would do it in a different way. I will say the food area is nice and tasty. Go early as there are long lines.,1
"When I visited, the place was fairly crowded. The temple was clean and was constructed beautifully. Krishna shrine was huge and ample space for people to sit. However, in order to exit the temple, the management has a commerical pitch like any other temple wherein you have food stalls and other small shops within. Eveything inside is priced high!",1

I love the place. I just love the ambience and the overall experience to be there. And you get really nice food here. The desserts are awesome. It is must visit if you are in Bangalore and love tranquility. Do visit.,1
"The temple is very beautiful and very nice surroundings, it is definitely the best ISKCON temple you can visit in India. We loved the food there it was tasty and very hygenic preparation unlike at other places. The aarti is also grand. Must visit for Lord Krishna devotees",1
Had a bad experience and got shouted at by the fellow just because i moved in a queue without chanting hare ram. Krishna represents pure love but i dint find that they believe in what they are preaching. Very bad experience and has left a bad impression. I wont be considering going there again.,1
"One of the must visit place in Bangalore. One can enrich the spiritual life. The lighting arrangements in the evening, is the best things to see in the city. Lot of tastey food and snacks are also available inside the temple campus.",1
"Over-hyped temple. May be a special place for ISKON members, but not the same for the others. Complicated way up and down the hill to exhaust you. Wastage of time. No peace, no serenity. Hyderabad ISKON though smaller is a much better place.",0
"The place is very big,well maintained and the main attracting thing about this place is it's a very peaceful place which is the very reason I myself have visited many many times and everything thing in Iskcon Temple is Just Perfect...",1
WELL MANAGED temple.good facility for senior citizens even providing lift.once u enter the main hall u feel relaxed,1
"Good place to early in the morning. You can participate in the prayers and bhajans.Also have hot kichidi they serve after the prayers which is pretty good.
Very close to the Green Line Metro station.",1
"This beautiful temple is one of the instittution of Hare Krishna. The ISKCON was founded in 1966 in New York by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. If you are interested about Bakthi Yoga and its practice, learn some basics here.
Tips : You will have to remove footwear. Suggest you donate an amount and that will help you to walk through a special queue less crowded.",1
good ambience and atmosphere. must see place in bangalore. it is a holy place of workship well maintained. only issue is with the approach road which is quite conjusted.,1
situated on a hillock and very near to Metro station. climbing steps maybe hindrance for senior citizens. idols are of marble &remind you of North india temples. delicious prasadam is served here. as usual marketing of sri krishna books and audio here also as in other Iskcon temples.,1
"located on a hill the temple is built on a small hill. Can be reached by Metro line.
Post the Darshan , lot of food stall a located before the exit . these delicacies are worth trying.",0
"This is the most beautiful Isckon temple I have seen, and it gives a good divine feeling. The temple is huge, you can take some time to walk around and explore it. The is a nice mantra chanting spot where you have to walk on tiles and a staircase until you complete the Hare Krsna Hare Rama mantra 108 times. There are a lot of books and souvenirs for sale, as well as nice eatery here. Go for it.",1
It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world. The temple is a huge cultural complex that was inaugurated in 1997 by Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma. There is free distribution of Sri Krishna prasadam to all visitors during the darshana hours.There is a gold-plated dhwaja-stambha (flag post) 17 m (56 ft) high and a gold plated kalash shikara 8.5 m (28 ft) high,1
"This is on higher level situated
Very long way to walk and climbed.
In temple there is full security
It's crowded place
There is. -different sculpture in entrance
Visit them",0
"It ia very nice to visit! Wear socks!!! You will not wear shoes for a very very very long time !!! And you have to walk a loooooot!!!
Nice experience though.
It is pretty basic.",0
Temple is one of the huge Iskcon temples. Peaceful place inside the premise. Temple spreading knowledge of HOLY GRANTH BHAGAWAD GIITA,1
"A serene place to visit which gives you a happy vibes by enchanting ""hare krishna mantra"" with a yummy prasadam. They have many stalls related to fast food, worship material and much more. It looks way more beautiful in evening and morning. I would recommend everyone to visit this temple atleast once.",1
I visited this temple on a spare day when working in Bangalore. The temple is spectacular and we found everyone very welcoming of a Christian visiting their holy place. There are many stalls selling food and trinkets which detract from the experience but similar to many Catholic Churches and Anglican Cathedrals really.,1
I have been this temple multiple time. In Delhi & Bangalore. Its very near to yashwantpura railway and metro station. But there will be always rush. But you can go and spend time pesefully.,1
"If you are living in Bengaluru, then visit to ISKCON temple becomes a must. So, take a day out and visit this place. If time permits, you can visit Orion Mall that's few meters away. People living in Bengaluru East can take Metro to Kempegpwda and then Green Line to Sandal Soap Factory.

I am not a religeous person, but I like being in calm, serene places. When I was roaming around the premises, the first thought that came to my mind was, everything in place is well thought. You start from one end and exit from other. People move around in one direction. Temple people take care of your footwear and luggge. Prasad that you get at the end of the journey was the most delicious and fulfilling prasad I have eaten till date. I felt like crying. I wonder why? :)
One earnest request to the visitors - At some places, taking photos and selfies is prohibited. Please be kind and follow that. People come here to find peace, not Facebook profile pictures.

One thing that bugged me though. Why should there be Pani puri and Samosa stalls in a temple? Somehow I did not like it. It did not go well with the overall atmosphere of the temple.

Second thing is a request to ISKCON temple management. Rickshaw-walas block temple's exit and don't budge at all. It was difficult for me to make my way through them.",1
"Strange place. I was looking for a spiritual place, this is a gaudy, loud, noisy eatery. Food and shopping. People are on cell phones all the time. It's not a temple, more a commercial enterprise. dont bother visitng unless you like starch, sugar and oil.",0
"It is a very good Krishna temple. Very neat and clean. Well managed, well appointed and spacious. Very good arrangement for Darshan. One can peacefully make Darshan. Very good eatery with hygienic food at very reasonable rates. Good parking. Recommended for visit.",1
"It is a beautiful temple. You can feel the vibes. The experience is great in the evening, when you can participate the prayers if you want. You. An also make donations at the exit and buy souvenirs and food.",1
"In my review earlier slight correction.
‚ÄúLady's‚Äù should read as LADDU
The auto fill in was the culprit
Have been to this temple since their opening about 8-9, years ago. I especially like the laddus from Tirupathi Balaji Temple.",1
"A magnificent piece of architecture that is neat and surrounded by neatness unlike the one in brindhaven on north.

Serene and beautiful architecture that is only impacted by the heavy traffic of bangalore",0
"Its one of the must visit places when you visit Bangalore - Very neat, peaceful and a great place for meditation.",1
"Must visit place in Bangalore.
this temple is truly vaikunta.
i had been to this temple more than 10 times. The ananda and bliss we feel in the temple seeing the dieties in immeasurable.",1
Must visit to get peace of mind . Far from the city but worth the visit. Accessible by metro. Do attend the main aarti it's spectacular,1
"It's a huge temple. You have to leave your shoes in the parking lot. As a visitor, I didn't know how meaningful that would be. After walking from the lot to the temple, you are now on a one-way trip. After observing the service, which we had very little choice in other than to make a scene, we were ushered out a different way than we came in. You either make a scene or you walk through their incredibly long gift shop and food stall track that dumped us out of the temple just about as far away from our shoes as could be - with no real idea where we were. We then wandered around for way too long looking for our shoes and our ride. Very skippable.",0
Peaceful and serene combined with divine spiritual feeling in the chants of 'Hare Ram Hare Krishna' Must visit place .,1
The place is located in one of the main parts of the city. And it's located in a hill top. Well maintained and well preserved place in bangalore.,1
Very nice and peaceful place. I love this place to visit again. You feel the presence of lords Krishna,1
"Wonderful architecture, good maintenance , nice fountain, range of gods...3d shows excellent food court free prasada marriage hall 5 star hoteland what not! My any time favorite area. Great accessories for spiritual as well as religious processes.",1
If to see something in Bangalore then this temple is a must to see. Be prepared for crowd especially during weekends but definitely worth to queuing,1
"Everytime i visit this temple i get a good vibes...the view from this temple is so good!!!the food they serve for devotees is so delicious,tasty...the maintenance of temple is so clean!!!",1
Good temple to visit if you stay near by and you will require atleast 2-3 hours to roam around and see the beautiful temple,1
"The idea and the history of the place is amazing. More than a religious thought, the service has to be appreciated. You must visit it to understand.",1
So many things in Bangalore are in and out in 10 mins. This was different and impressive. Worth visiting if this side of town,1
Visited with my father. Very peaceful and satisfying. My dad enjoyed a lot and we had food also there.,1
"Visit this temple for a holistic sampling of Hinduism. Dedicated to Lord Krishna, the divine cowherd, the majestic temple offers orderly, meticulous worship in a cool marble ambience. The prasad or culinary offering to the Lord,incorporates delectable vegetarian delights from world cuisine, in keeping with Iskcon's international profile. Visit the multi-cuisine restaurant inside the complex for the tastiest meal, post-darshan. Govinda must have been a gourmet!",1
"ISKCON is one of the most beautiful temples in India and can get really crowded at time, especially during festivals. The temple is located in a very nice uphill terrain, albeit covered with cemented steps now. The idols are the most important aspect of any temple, and the idols here are just captivating. A midnight aarati was conducted on the day of Janmashtami, and it was a great experience to be a part of it.",1
"This temple is located on the hills containing temples,marriage halls. During night this location gives good view of the illuminated city around. Occasional festivals makes this place more glittering.",1
"A temple which attracts a lot of devotees and tourists. Situated on Chord Road, near Sandal Soap Factory, it has become one of Bangalore's landmark.
The main temple is for Lord Krishna and his consorts. Regular poojas are held and for devotees who have paid for specific poojas, Prasad is served.
Managed by ISKCON, the people who feed children through their Akshaya Patra scheme.
There is also multicuisine vegetarian restaurant that serve only sattvic food, in the premises.",1
"The place is located about 300 m from the metro station. Getting in of course is a task so select your time carefully. The queue can get very long and tiring. Once inside you can spend some time to look at the architecture and some photos. Getting inside the owner temple also is a huge queue. Once finished, you can pick up some wonderful stuff. Its a huge area like a mini market. Those who like to purchase stuff for home ‚ÄúMandira‚Äù would find a huge number of items.",0
"It was a wonderful experience to visit the ISKCON temple during Deepotsav, just a day after Diwali. They have a very nice, organized system for Darshan. We took a Rs 500 special family pass ,which allows upto 6 persons and includes a short aarti and Prasad and convenient Darshan. Taking the pass was worth and value for money ,going by the efficiency with which everything was handled
Would recommend a visit to anyone who is also not spiritually inclined ,just to experience the beauty and magnificense of the temple. Also heard a lot about the restaurant and other foods offered there but didn't have enough time to try that out .",1
"Temple is beautiful but there one small mall at temple to sell products,and its very expensive that not good.",1
Visiting iskon is like my friends favorite thing as u get pongal as prasad and they love it. It's easily visited as there is metro nearby like 500 mtrs away. The place has a nice calm and wen I visited there was bhajan going on which was great,1
First time at a temple and this did not disappoint. Architecture was interesting and got to watch the closing prayers at about 12:40. I was uncomfortable going barefoot but the floors were clean. Don't be surprised with the commercialism under the temple on the way out,1
"This temple is exquisite! A must see in Bangalore. Although I'm not Hindu, this temple is awe inspiring in it's design.",1
"Beautiful Landmark on west of chord road reachable by all modes of transport. All shrines inside temple are beautifully are decorated daily including the main deity and Poojas done as per religious shastras. Devotees can have darshan, do dhyan before the deity and relish prasadams.",1
You must visit this place if you are in bangalore. The way they have decorated the place and the god and the way they offer prayers to god is beautiful. I feel very peaceful when I visit this place.,1
"Went as a tourist rather than a devotee. Certainly worth seeing, although we went on a public holiday so it was quite crowded. Most of the folks there were more interested in taking selfies rather than enjoying the divinity, but such is life these days!",1
"Iskon is placed in rajajinagar,very well maintained need ,it has good view here ram hare Krishna.Anna Danam is vishesh of iskon",1
As a westerner I found the temple very beautiful and interesting. The monks were very friendly and made me feel welcome.,1
corporate style..ok to visit....cleanliness isbgood..2-3 hours to complete darshan.... overall good temple to visit..,1
The ISKCON temple in its grandeur is the site to behold. Looks beautiful under lights. Very good place to visit during festival time,1
"Located in the heart of the city, you can't miss it if you're in Bangalore.

Must visit, beautiful temple.",1
"Very organized and systematic in making sure there is no conjunction on the crowd. Clean and very pleasant. Well maintained, friendly care takers and very welcoming community. Majestic look and royal feeling as you enter in.",1
The ISKCON temple is a must visited place which is quite approachable from the local metro. It offers a shopping place as well.,1
"Its more of a tourist place than a temple, you can go there once to see the majestic structure, do some shopping, have a free prasada, other than that its not like other old temples(atleast for me)",1
Its a nice outing . Grand place . Very religious but respects and welcomes everyone . Really beautiful,1
A visit to ISKCON Temple in Bengaluru is a must for any traveler. The entire campus is very well planned. There are several temples within the campus with the main temple at the top. One can appreciate the beautiful architecture and get positive vibes when visiting the same.,1
"A great place for any Hindu or anyone interested in knowing about what it is it about being a Hindu, should visit this place wonderful place. Its a wonderful cluster of temples and more over a peaceful and enchanting environment with ever smiling and ever willing to help Krishna devotees.

As an added benefit you will find is that you can't probably find anywhere else on earth is the variety of tasty satvik vegetarian food. Apart from the prasad, you have nice restaurant that cater to different kinds of needs and food stalls that make you feel vegetarian food is heaven!

Must visit for any vegetarian, Hindu or a Krishna devotee...",1
It's an excellent place to pass leisure time. Nice bhog of Lord Krishna is available. It give a wonderful feeling while sitting in front of lord Krishna..,0
Kept getting yelled at for not knowing what to do or go. Thought the Krishnas were calm. Give it a miss.,0
"Must visit place, love this place, big temple in temple in Bangalore, crowded place but holy, love to see the inside the temple",1
"This is the place you will love to visit with your family. You will feel strong positive aura once you enter the main temple. Temple is very well managed and clean. It has ample space for 2 and 4 wheeler parking. Don't miss to taste the food, coconut sweets and snacks. You will everything at affordable price and worth a try.",1
"They are very happy about articttect of the temple and its location at Hilton top ,city view at bottom ,butiful Radhakrishnan Idols, Laxmi Narayan,Lord venkateswara sweet prasadam etc .I too enjoyed the silent meditation and Bajan",1
"I went there for prayers; ending up being overwhelmed with the structure and magnitude of the whole set up. The prayer area is a joy, peace for the mind",1
The ISKCON temple is a great place to visit which houses several temples of shri krishna which is maintained in a great way.,1
The place is a holy place for Krishna devotees. A great temple with an attached shopping center. Worth visiting.,1
"this temple is on the must visit places in bangalore,,it is a huge complex,after your temple visit you have organic shopping ,and agood selection of eatables.",1
"Good place to visit the temple. I visited with family and it was a good pleasent Trip. Good connectivity with metro, local bus transportation n auto available.",0
Visited the temple on janamashtami. Loved the way temple was decorated and the day well spent. So many activities to do and feeding the cows was so much fun and who's miss the prasadam..,1
I keep going to this place whenever I have visitors at home. I personally like the architecture the cleanliness of the temple. Also when you chant hare krishna and step on the stones it gives you a different feel which I cannot express in words. Food is quite amazing here. My personal favorite is Amul ladoo.,1
"A temple visit has different meanings for different people. For the devout, it is a pure and simple opportunity to relate to an idol and a beautiful divine experience. The casually religious may look for more including a family outing and a place to have 'heavenly foods'.
ISKCON is a remarkable temple and community gathering place, offering a bit of everything to everyone, in a well organized, clean, safe environment. While the devout may be a little disappointed with the crowds and the market atmosphere, they too can experience their own inner peace in the middle of the great hall if they tune out the hustle around them. They too can experience the beauty of the avatars on the walk up the stairs. For the rest of us, an ISKCON visit can offer the benefit of a very well organized walk to the great hall, the visual beauty of the decorated 'vigraha/idol', the amazing variety of vegetarian snacks and sweets, a place to buy illuminating books on Hindu philosophy, agarbathi, lights, old school book stands, and even a marriage hall or two!! Of course, the 'prasada' at the end of the darshan can itself be very filling. The aptly named ""Higher Taste"" serves an amazing buffet of sattvic prepared vegetarian food at a slightly higher price, well worth it for those who are hungry and can afford it. ISKCON also offers some degree of assistance to the less physically abled and the older senior citizens in the form transport and wheelchairs. Children too are often happy to come to ISKCON and can find Krishna related activities or quizzes regarding the founder to amuse them. Transport is convenient with with the Sandal Soap factory / Orion mall metro station close by. Overall, ISKCON replicates the community temple that must have been part of the temple ethos in centuries past.",1
"I had been to ISKCON Temple multiple number of times when i was in Bangalore for my further studies for around 3 years. This was one of my favourite spot as it was very near to my PG at Rajajinagar, Bangalore",0
Though I took special visit as my sister was there and being a paid visit it was easier to get closer to main god of temple. I like the place a lot and it is a good place to see,1
"I had been to ISKON temple years ago . This was my second visit . The darshan was wonderful . What disturbed me was the commercialism which has developed. All the exits go through the shopping booths and you have to pass through the food court . Hundred percent chances of youngsters throwing a fit for eatables.
The shopping and eating should be in a different area. Here we should just have a peaceful darshan .",1

Nice Place. A Joyful place where anyone get peace. Also it is neat and clean. You can reached easily there by Metro (Sandal Soap Factory).,1
"We visit the temple regularly specially for some time to meditate peacefully. The deities are lifelike and a visit during aarti is a heavenly experience. Love the whole ambience with beautiful floral decorations, the kirtan, the insence, the traditional lamps et al. This time during janmashtami festival had the opportunity to witness the abhiskeka ceremony. It was ethereal...a not to be missed experience.",1
"I am very impressed with the ideals of ISKCON - decoding spirituality so it is understandable and palatable for the masses, spreading the word of the Bhagwad Gita in simple terms so people are inspired to live by its ideals. There is some really good work being done by ISKCON at the ground level, including the NIVE (National Institute of Value Education) tie-up with city schools to impart value education to youngsters in a non-preachy, interesting way. My daughter herself has benefited immensely from the program being run at her school.
So naturally I was keen to visit ISKCON having spent 12 years in Bangalore and not having gone even once. The temple is easily accessible by foot from the Mahalakshmi Metro station and the cleanliness, maintenance of premises and arrangements for darshan etc. are impeccable. One sore point was my 10 year old daughter - who is tall for her age - being admonished for wearing a frock. We were advised to dress her in attire covering her legs the next time. And we saw young ladies wearing cold-shouldered T-Shirts and sleeveless tees (more power to them - I am no one to tell people how to dress, but just to highlight the unfair discrimination) -allowed to go in with nary a glance.
We got over this pretty quickly and made our way to the main sanctum. A visual spectacle of grandeur and a lovely set of idols of the Lord and his consorts awaited us. The chanting of bhajans only added to the atmosphere and inspite of the swelling crowd, we were briefly transported to another world.
Once the darshan was over was when the ""marketing"" started. The exit route ensures you have to visit no less than 20 stalls, selling items from books to sweetmeats, savouries, baked goods, knick-knacks for children, ISKCON merchandise, clothing and surprisingly - Chhotta Bheem stationery! I understand that a lot of people come to the temple to make a day outing of it, but at least the option of making an exit without meandering your way through this blatant display of commercialism should be available to others.
Would still recommend a visit to the temple. It is worth going just to glimpse the Lord in all his glory and listen to the rhythmic chanting of Hare Rama Hare Krishna to calm your mind and soul.",1
"Like all ISKON temples Bangalore Iskon is also a place to visit , it gives immense pleasure and peace to listen chanting of ""Harray Rama Harray Krishna"", Its a great place to visit.",1
Good place.we will come to next.but need to clen and tidy more.to less of public transpost.all the karnatka people behaviour is pathetic.they dont respect national language.,1
The temple is not only a place of worship but surrendering yourself to the peace. Good to go. Spend time,1
"This was a truly holistic experience. I recommend buying the VIP ticket for 500 rupees. Once passes the ticket hall, you will have to rent a bag to place your shoes into (2 rupees per person). Be ready to walk through the temple bare feet having washed hands and feet. Handover your VIP ticket in the temple when you get to the book stand. You will be given a small present!! Men must wear long trousers (including teenagers). Women must cover legs and shoulders.",1
Krishna temple -hare ram hare krishna -such a peaceful place as this place allows me to think peacefully that god is there . The best tjme to visit ISKON mandir is in evening time when aarti is going on .,1
"Yes. U visited this temple a while ago. It's at a height and is usually crowded. If you've problem with sitting in lines/ or any health problem like suffocation due to crowds; Don't visit.
While in the other hand, evening is the best time to visit this temple üòå it's a holy place. Maintain peace and harmony.",1
"Chanting Hare Rama - Hare Krishna or simply seating in main temple will get you to connect with self and get some inner peace. The beauty and grandness of this temple has always attracted me. Though bit commercialized, it doesn't fail to give the feeling of someone beyond human bounds.",1
"Very nice temple of HINDUS in heart of city before it was a remote area but now after rapid development of Bangalore city now it's in heart of city surrounded by all time big mall and all nice hotels

It's a well architect temple and very neat and clean",1
I have been going here from last 3 to 4 years. I enjoy the view of Bangalore from every time and also get to meditate and spend some time in solitude with fresh and cold breeze.,1
"One of the most beautiful modern temples that I have seen. The deities are beautifully decorated and darshan is not hurried.
While some may not like the commercial aspect encountered after darshan, such a large facility does require money to manage!",1
Beautiful temple. Very well maintained. Well organised. And is a must visit if you're in the locality. The food in the restaurant is also amazing.,0
"We have visited here with family and kids. My baby enjoyed a lot here. It's so cool and awesome place, that you don't feel that strain of standing in queue. Darshan of God made us so happy and heart filling. After your long wait in queues you are not hurried to get out, instead you can sit in front of God on floor and spend as much time you want to. You can just enjoy that environment and atmosphere. Best place to spend time with family and kids.",1
Very pleasant and peaceful for all types of people and very happiest place in the city of in my opinion,1
Yeah iskcon temple is very very peaceful for young people and old people and very near to orien mall,1
"A pious, peaceful and incredibly beautiful place. The entrance is well structured and can accommodate huge crowd gracefully. The structure of the temple consists of three main temples, found at each level. Hare Ram Hare Krishna reverberates and creates a positive vibe. The ceiling in the main Krishna Temple is a treat to watch. It also houses a lot of commercial stalls which sell brass apparatus for worship, handloom clothes etc. Overall a nice place to spend your evening with family and friends.",1
this is a great place for peace. I went to the temple and liked the architecture very much and it is very beautiful inside the temple you will get a lot of sweets and food varieties but they are little bit expensive. You also get books at cheaper costs.,1
Very serene temple. Whether you are a devotee or a tourist...its worth a visit. Please do wear proper clothing and be respectful here.,1
"we visited temple in the evening. Entry for general public is thru separate gate. If you want to have priority darshan you can buy ticket for the same else go in normal line. Photography inside temple is strictly prohibited. you can buy food and snacks from temple premises at exorbitant price.
temple is slowly being crowded by the upcoming high rises buildings nearby",1
"Hare Krishna!

Need I say more? Yes. Very green campus with excellent facilities and logistic arrangements.",1
"Very calm place and amazing temple of lord krshna, I have enjoyed lot when I was visited, wonderful place, it look most beautiful when visit should be at evening time",1
I visited before few month with some friends.Its very Good and decent restaurant in that area.its pure veg restaurant..They are serving north Indian food with Rajshthani taste.,1
"Very neat and well maintained temple. A pious, peaceful and incredibly beautiful place. The entrance is well structured and can accommodate huge crowd gracefully. Temple Has good security arrangement and enough parking space.",1
"Very peaceful and highly Devine atmosphere.

Morning time or evening time is nice to visit and feel. You can also see surround area from this temple.",1
Such a nice place. Over placed for canteen which resembles a tiny market instead of temple environment.,1
This is near to my hotel here I stay and it is nice designs this temple has and nice sweets I took in this hotel.,1
"Temple is really nice , architecture is amazing , love the gold thing inside the temple. Everything was good.

The place was clean nd well maintained. We spent almost 3 to 4 hrs there.

Must visit.",1
"It was some time since I walked streets barefoot :) But that's how you get inside the temple, no other option. And also no shortcuts on the grounds to get into the temple - you are guided by wards and signs through the yard left and right, up and down, but not straightforward. Well, more hints and hues, tourists are supposed to love it ;)
Once in the temple, a very pleasant monk welcomed me, explained shortly the whats and hows, and performed a private ‚Äúbless your family‚Äù ceremony, while I and the crowd around were chanting away ‚ÄúHare Krishna...‚Äù mantra for ... how long? Could be I repeated it 108 times? :)
Felt as good as refreshing shower!

As with most tourist attractions, the way out led through a souvenir shop. But no! It was a souvenir market maze, and took me not less time than the above ceremony!",1
"Ganagapur in gulbarga district is the famous temple place of lord Dattatraya. Wanted to visit since long time, finally got a contact there Trimurty Residency, 9980532880 Datta pujari who helped guiding us and providing accommodation food at very low price. He is priest in temple so helped doing puja and Darshan thank you..very powerful pace..",1
"Like other ISKON, this is also a beautiful one. They also sell some good food stuff at a very reasonable price but their (ISKON) khichdi prasaad is something out of the world. It's very sad to see that some people used to waste that as well by throwing it on the path. If you do not like khichdi, please do not accept it. A must visit temple.",0
"Krishna is worshipped by millions all over the world. There are many Krishna temples but the Iskcon temple is very well keep and worth a visit. It was Prabhupada who wanted to spread the message of Krishna consciousness so he started the international society for Krishna consciousness and built various Krishna temples all over the world. They really keep the premises very clean and very systematic darshan is offered to the visitors. They have books and magazines for visitors to buy. The Prasad counters are also very clean and there are volunteer's to guide you all through. The visit gives you an unique experience, and is one of the must visit places",1
"Located in yeshwanthpur, ISKCON is one of the must visits if you are in Bengaluru.
The whole place is well maintained and decorated.
It gets closed by 8 30 on weekends. Sometimes it will get difficult to park four wheeler on special/weekends.",1
"ISKCON is located in one of the most popular area in Bangalore called Yashwantpura. ISKCON one of the spiritual temple where u can find all the people visiting to the place. During Brahmotsavam the crowd will be huge and the whole ISKCON will be decorated with the lights and one can seek blessings from Lord krishna.

Must visit place",1
"Visited the very popular ISKCON temple on a weekday afternoon. The place is very well maintained, and wasn't that crowded. The access was very easy and there were a large variety of eatables and prasadam also available. To escape the city traffic, it's highly recommended to use the metro rail to reach this Krishna temple.",1
"A good day out to link with God and some meditation..... Highly recommended !!!!
Try reaching in early hours",1
"temple is really nice , architecture is amazing , love the gold thing inside the temple. but one thing makes me wonder is if we want to do any pooja you have to pay for that which is not good . we also believe in god we also go to temple at north india but we doesn't pay for any pooja. its upto us how much we want to give a donation from our heart . this thing should be changed. other than that everything was good",1
"Very neat and clean temple. Parking is available at cost. Well maintained, there are many kiosks for shopping too.",1
Very good temple. Serves excellent food in their canteen - pure vegetarian as well as without onion and garlic.,1
Visited as part of tour of Bangalore. Made it the first stop - so there by 10am and was therefore quite quiet - looking at the queue barriers I would imagine it gets very busy. The serenity of the temple is evident and the spectacle of the gold and colours is awe inspiring.,1
"No doubt beautiful place..
But access to this place is not so comfortable..it's on hill and narrow and rowdy terrain to reach .
Near to mandir roads are good and maintained..
Do take blesssings in form of Prasada and buy products from there to contribute indirectly .",1
Its one of the most beautiful ISKCON temples in the country. Never very crowded and very peaceful. The Prasad is excellent,1
"Iskcon temple is super , the lord Krishna and radha are looking awesome and they are symbol of love.",1
It was my second visit to iskon. I just do not want to miss iskon whenever i come to banglore. Lovely temple. Well managed.,1
I was in the night and had an opportunity to see the festival. amazing experience- sad that we can't do photos,1
"Place is really beautiful made with all of articulation and sculpture made on wall temples. Inside the temple, there are many stalls of cloths, sweets,fast food items which were unnecessary. Temple itself was huge and build properly. Must visit one time",1
"I went for Aarti and it is truly beautiful. Photography is strictly prohibited but we can't resist to click. Be prepared for long walk to enter and exit the main Garbha temple.
Accomdation is available inside the temple which is good and decent. Food is great and the Prasadam outside the temple is heavenly.",1
"I have visited here multiple times to seek the blessing of Lord Krishna. This is a very big temple and management is top class seeing thousands of visitors everyday where you can find peace and grace of krishna chanting people . Lots of stalls in the premises of this temple where you can buy books,audio,suveniours ,food and many other things.",1
We had been to the ISCON temple in the evening. There was not much of a rush. But still visitors in reasonable number were there. There was queue. Everyone was obeying rules. The line moved fast. We had darshan comfortably. We bought prasad. There was free distribution of prasad too.,1
"such a interesting place for devotional and attractive construction, which will push you to visit again and again",1
"Really enjoyed this huge temple. For Westerners, especially men, be sure to wear long pants or ask to rent a wrap at the security check. Its not automatically offered.

Once inside Its a really spiritual place. Not too many foreigners, so it has a real local feel.",1
"As said rejuvenate yourself by going there, in spite of the crowd out there you get your peace of mind..",0
Nice architect and peaceful place. The deities look real ones. The live and continuous kirtan is mesmerising.,1
"This a very spiritually vibrant place. a place of worship, chanting and remembering god.
Devotees here are good and inspiring.
Prasad quality is very good, one can even take to full stomach with some donations.

I would suggest that one goes there, he/she should buy Bhagawat Gita from there. and read atleast 2 slokas every day. by that way, one can complete 70 slokas in one year.

I would like to visit again and again.",1
"Properly maintained.
Peaceful.
Reaching there was bit difficult as we are starting too far from the temple.",0
"I visited iskon temple,Bangalore dated 06 May 2019 .

It was a wonder full experience and I reached nearly 6pm and remain their till 9:30 pm.on that day it Rained heavily which I will never forget.

This was the special invitation from lord Krishna to visit the temple as I m from Delhi.

If I again come to banglore then I will again visit iskon temple

Iskon temple was fantastic with beautiful scenery and design

I was impressed by the devotion of local people and pujari who were continuously chanting lord Krishna bhajan.

Hare Krishna Hare Rama

With Healthy Regards

Dr Pramod",1
"Nice ambiance. Car goes almost near the temple. Physically handicapped also can have darshan. Special arrangements are there. We had ""Prasadam"" in the evening.
Wonderful place to visit.",1
"Great pace to visit ,approachable,clean,disciplined crowd.atleast visit once type property.amazing construction",1
I had been here with my friends and was awesome.. specially evening aarthi I have enjoyed the most.. i would be suggesting to visit once to everyone for mental peace..,1
"However this place is little commercialised but anyways they have maintained it superbly, ambience is filled with mesmerising smell, bhajan kirthan sound will make you feel divine. please check the timing before you go else your long journey will become futile.",1
Iskcon temple is one of the famous lord Krishna temple in Bangalore it is situated in Rajajinagar very nice place inside the temple is beautiful and we can spend more time with peaceful mind parking facility is there we can get Prasad all time,1
Didn't like this one little bit. Seemed to me to be more like a theme park than a temple. All about money making and very little about spiritual wellbeing sadly.,1
Nice place. Serene. A bit of a cult following. You may not like the undue pressure to chant Hare Krishna. Has lunch on offer too. Tip : adults dressed in shorts may not be let in.,1
"This temple visit is just divinely beautiful and magnificent experience. You can visit anytime, while open hours and have seated and do meditate at your convenience.",1
"First of all the temple is located at a good location right near Orion mall.. so it does attracts people.
The only bad thing is the long distance steps .. old people walking through many steps ups and downs us not a happy part..they should make sooner arrangements for people who can not talk more in the steps due to thier issues.other wise the hall painted with lord in the top wall is something creative with God's blessings..",0
The hare Rama Hare Krishna is really beautiful from the inside . The chanting of Hare Krishna is really soothing to the mind . Quite crowded during weekends and evenings . The food is great and wide variety of food stalls to choose from.,1
"Easy access for the old, lift with least walk. Well organised even when very busy. Loads of devotees. Beautiful temple decor. Saw aarti. Got prasad.",1
Really it is a excellent place of visit. I like it very much. It is peace full and having a spiritual thinking.,1
"My favourite place to feel the presence of energy that energises you at the start of the day and calms you down at the end of the day...
The best place to visit the Temple is for the Darshan Aarti at 7:30 am or the Shayana Aarti at 8:00 pm. I like the Shayana Aarti more...
Placed on a hill top, the vast temple area has abundant light and air... The evening wind breeze while the devotees sing bhajans in a soothing lighting invokes a beautiful feeling within me that I cant describe...
Everyone should definitely experience it once...",1

"We visited this temple while on visit to Bengaluru and had a great time. There is a dress code for women as in Western dresses are not allowed and something with dupatta is preferred. So keep in mind about the dress code.

There is a small Pooja that can be offered which is chargeable but it is really nice and allows you to sit in front of the main temple. Pandits do the flower Abhishek on god along with chanting.

While walking toward the main temple one needs to walk 108 step and chant the mantra... which is an experience in itself.

There are lot of shops in the temple premises at the exit which is just like mall and offers a huge variety of food items and also for shopping.

Overall it's a beautiful temple which offers lot of peace and happiness.",1
"ISKCON Bangalore is a beautiful,ornate temple.This temple is made in a way that once you enter,the path is all one way and you end up in the main hall.All the statues,decor is grand and breathtaking at the first site.On the way out,one has to go thru the market place and food stalls setup by the temple.The passage from entry to the main hall is quite long and on a warm summer day,it is difficult to walk barefoot there.

CONS: Swamis/people at the temple are too pushy to get you to enroll for Akshaya patra meal and sell different stuff",1
"Spending lovely day out with friends on weekends...like to visit again and again .

Lovely temple and very interested people of India .",1
"A wonderful sightseeing spot , a must do when in Bangalore ...the food is ok ...the shopping is good . overall an experience ... opulence more Divinity less .",1
This is one of the nice ISKCON temples - the 108 steps chanting is a nice concept. Couple of things to improve - restrict photos/cell phones and make it little less commercial.,1
Visited the temple to understand more of the Hindu cultural. Very interesting place. At the end of the tour the monk was to overwhelming in trying to teach you the basics and purchase items from the store. Overall a good experience,1
"This temple has such beautiful idols... You will experience calmness when you enter inside...please do visit
.",1
"ISKCON Bangalore is arguably the best built structure and stands out both in terms of the size and grandeour. The temple, built over 30 years ago houses Shri Narasimha, Shri Balaji and Shri Radha-Krishna in separate sanctums. The visitor is guided through a carefully laid out path in such a way one gets to have darshan in peace. Even during the Bramhotsava time, the crowd was effectively managed, which is commendable.

The prasada counters sell a variety of food / sweets which is tasty and good. Toilets are available and parking is adequate too. Wheelchair borne devotees can use the earmarked entrace to enter and exit the temple, which is very helpful.

Visit at dawn or dusk for a better experience. The evening arti is wonderful.. Being a temple, devotees are advised to dress modestly. Shorts, night dresses etc. are not allowed inside.

ISKCON could be reached via Rajaji nagar by road or via Metro (Mahalakshmi Metro is 400m ahead).",0
"Lord Krishna's blessings for Bangalore crowd
.Love the place, food and ambience. Every corner is filled with holy wishes of Krishna. Hare Ram Hare Krishna everywhere.You can buy cool souvenirs.",1
"The crowd management is really good, with systematic bars for queues. You need to be dressed well to be allowed inside. If you are wearing shorts they will provide a lungi for guys and for girls a saree to drape, a security deposit needs to be paid. We need to submit our backpacks and footwear at the counter, coupons provided. The structure is beautiful and the place is calm and peaceful.",1
Nice and peaceful environment....Well maintained temple...Spend about a hour plus and its worth visiting it...Too good peace and calm....Over weekend it may be rush so plan accordingly....Little far from main city....But if you in bangalore...Then for sure you should explore...It's part of local site seeing tours as well..Otherwise you can hire a cab or auto very easily to visit this place if you are a tourist...,1
"Best temple in Bangalore. Beautiful very calm, clean and holy place must visited place for new comer to bangalore",1
Love the temple. mesmerizing structure. prasad was too yummy. silent and energizing. too large. it take 40 minutes to fully cover the temple. no one ask for daksina.,1
A nice temple to visit and is nearer to metro station. Nice view of the temple in the evening with lighting.,1
Nice and calm place. We get very relaxed at this place. Surrounding of this place is good. Quite near to Metro Train too.,1
"Not like most of the other Iscon temples, this is different. One can experience the difference by just being in the premises.",1
"As usual Iskcon always gives the best experience. This time it was more awesome. The entry it self amazing. Poojari asked us chant and go through a spl queue so that we complete Hare Rama Hare Krishna mantra 108 times by the time we complete the special queue for this chanting. Later there was a little crowd but not so much difficult. We had keep footwear in a counter for safety. That was a bit longer distance. But it's ok. Overall its amazing experience. You can have food in Iskcon itself they have stores for food, clothes and collectibles of Lord Krishna. You can also buy nice books.",1
"It's a mega temple...too big.. one of the biggest.. It has been very well maintained and proper managed by the staff ... Do visit late in the evning to view the lighting. There are 108 steps to climb wherein one can sacredly chant - Hare Krishna maha-mantra for 108 times. The view from the top of the Bangalore City was also awesome. On the return, dont forget maha prasad as well as one can buy various food items, clothes religious books, etc..",1
Very nice place with neat ambience.. Very ner to local metro train. In the evening times very cool pleasant breeze and ambience,1
Good experience... Especially in the evenings...serene atmosphere...lovely ambience.. Overall a lovely experience,1
"ISKCON temple in Bangalore is a temple dedicated to Lord Krishna.

Although the temple is well maintained but the place is too commercialised.",1
"Temple is really good & well maintained, Clean & beautiful,
One of the Best Lord Krishna temple in the World.",1
The ISKCON temple in Bengaluru is one of the biggest ISKCON temple that we have visited till date. The temple is located on a slightly elevated feature and is beautifully constructed. We had been here for the evening aarti at 7 PM and enjoyed the peace tranquility and the atmosphere of devotion here.,1
"Sri Radha Krishna Temple has deities of Radha and Krishna located at Rajajinagar, in North Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world.

Hare Krishna Hill is the hillock on which this temple is situated. ISKCON Bangalore is a charitable society with the objective of propagating Krishna Consciousness all over the world. There is a gold-plated dhwaja-stambha (flag post) 17 m (56 ft) high and a gold plated kalash shikara 8.5 m (28 ft) high. There is free distribution of Sri Krishna prasadam to all visitors during the darshana hours.

The temple is open from 4:30 a.m. to 5:00 am. The day begins with a Grand arati ceremony called mangala-arati. The temple again opens at 7:15 a.m. for Shringara Darshana Arati. 5:15 a.m. to 7:15 a.m.: Japa Meditation session. The temple remains open till 1:00 p.m. In the evening the temple is open from 4:15 p.m. to 8:15 p.m. During weekends and public holidays Temple timings are 4:30 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. without any break in the afternoon. The evening arati starts at 7:00 p.m. where devotees sing kirtan.

The exit way after the Darshan from the main temple leads through a series of shops that offer books. Apart from these things, there are various shops which provide eatables of large varieties including laddoo, cheese cake, samosa, milk shakes, chithrana (lemon rice), puliogare, pakodas, etc. The overall view of these markets provide everything that a devotee visiting a temple would need.",1
Must see place when visiting Bangalore. Easy access by road or Metro. Well maintained temple with modern amenities.,1
This is largest temple by Iskon of Lord Krishna in Bangalore. This is very near to Yeshwantpur railway station.Must visit temple in Bangalore.,1
"The best part of a visit to ISKON is being part of the Aarti which they perform in the evenings and mornings. I have found the atmosphere in the evening one's to be better. There is something undesirable about it : I guess it's the combined Bhakti / belief of people which help create it. The climb up the stairs (it's built on hill / huge rock) can be a bothersome under the sun, but it's not that strenuous. There are smaller temples built in a couple of stages as one climbs up.

One Sunday morning's one can join into one of sessions / discourses. There is a good restaurant with excellent options within the campus.

Don't enjoy the place when it's over crowded (seems most of the days now !), which is why I have preferred morning visits. Also feel it's increasingly becoming more commercial. But guess all of India is :(",1
"I have visited temple during my business trip. As person from Europe, I didn't know much about Hinduism and Hare Krishna. At the entrance, someone wanted some money and ask us to select one option from 300, 500, 1000 and 2500 rupees. Had no idea what is what and selected for 500rupees. Actually, it seems it is kind of plan and it covers up to 6 people. When we climbed up to temple, someone heading us to go somewhere else than others, probably power of our ticket. There were no queues, so it was not helpful at all. When temple reached, there is taking photos forbidden! We could enjoy relaxing atmosphere when we was waiting for something what we didn't know. Finally we were participating on pray, Hare Krishna hare, hare hare hare...my first experience with that! After praying we have got some sweets. When all is finished you will pass lots of shops with books, food and souvenirs. As it is typical for India, when you show interest, people are very pushing you to buy, so be careful ;)
To summarize all above, I like this experience!
Forgot one item, there is not allowed to wear shoes! Be ready!",1
"One of the most beautifull and attractive hindu temple in Bangalore.Inside the temple you can buy lot of gift items which related to hindu culture.If you are a book lover,you can find some nice books as well.Orian shopping mall also located in walking distance",1
Nice place to spend some quality time with family and friends I went there recently first time but the view was quite different for me compared to Kolkata n surats iscon temple,1
"I visit this temple at least once every year, sometimes more. This is one of the most beautiful temples and it gives the feeling that GOD actually resides in there. The sevas that happen especially at night just before closing, where they are singing bhajans and putting God to sleep is one of the best experiences in an Indian temple ever. So much joy, peace, tranquility and a place where really GOD is celebrated and cherished.",1
The temple xomplex is a very nicely made with three temples to be visited. The main temple is the largest complex. The main attraction is the annadata langar. Neat clean and tasty food served. Not to be missed. There is a restaurant serving satvik food too,1
Iskcon temple in Bangalore is an excellent modern architectural temple. It is a temple which is kept very clean and peaceful atmosphere It is worth visiting .,0
"If u r looking for inner peace then this is the place. The place is buzzing always with good vibes and energy

The food also is amazing. Do try",1
"Nice and lavish but does seem not so authentic. Preaty far from center of bangalore. The city itself has no much attractions, and this temple is one of them",0
"soul searching place to visit, to cleanse yourself. family visit with plenty to see and history to take time to enjoy,",1
"This Krsna temple is a cultural hub sitting at a hillock close to Mahalakshmi Layout on west of chord road .. The nearest metro station is Mahalakshmi and the temple is a five min walk ..Usually the place is filled with devotees and visitors or any given day so expect atleast a few min in queue if you plan to visit the place.. We have a paid service which is quicker if you want to save time .. The architecture and whole place is filled with Hare Krsna Hare Ksna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare ,, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare chant ... They sell devotional books along with few interesting shopping things along with lots of food as an option... Good place to learn about Krsna and culture ... Ypu can meditate in the main hall if you have time... Parking is available at a price and strictly Indian attire is only allowed...enjoy and immerse in Krsna conscious.... god bless",1
"I am an ISKCON life member and have visited ISKCON temples all over the world, and generally liked them I have also stayed at some of the facilities. However, ISKCON Bangalore was a blatant show of commercialism - they asked for money at every stage, tried to force me to buy services and books that I did not want. This experience has left me disillusioned and will probably discourage me from visiting other ISKCON temples in future.",1
It was very Good Experience visiting to ISKON TEMPLE. Very neat and clean place. Well managed. Nearby metro station. Beautiful view. Inside there is a very good food court. Prasad is very good.,1
"Have been there multiple times and the place is good attraction for Tourist. Right outside the metro station, the place is easily accessible. Can take a few hours to complete the darshan",1
"It's a spiritual place, where we can spend time there calm environment and all amenities are there.
Kids and family will enjoy being there, always crowded and safe place.
Surrounding is very neat and clean.",1
"The visit to the Iskon temple in Bangalore is an eye opener. Very orderly - clean and calm atmosphere stays with you even after you leave. The darshan are easy - you can spend little more time than you would normally do. The Parasadam and the Lunch served is very satisfying - quantity, quality as well as the taste and the overall experience !",1
"In Bengaluru ISKCON temple is the well known place, every kind of human being are came in here. This place atmosphere is so peaceful and so lovely.",1
"Fabulous location and divinely inspired. Very safe for kids and all the facilities are awesome.

Don't miss this place if your are visiting Bangalore.",0
"If you are in Bangalore you must visit the place. If you want spiritual enlightenment I am not sure if this will suit you unless you are an iSCON member. I think it is too commercialised.
They have a saatvik restaurant and one can get a good meal there. In fact you arrange a small party there with prior arrangement. Places where one can arrange functions like wedding, birthday, etc. are also there.",1
"This is the temple of Krishna. You should visit when you are in Bengaluru. Entrance fee is basically not required. If you pay 300, 500 or 1000 INR, you can go through fast lane, are purified with a candle or get some gifts.",1
The ISKCON Temple is maintained very wel.l Good place to visit with friends and family members.. visit this place at any time and during any month in the year and experience yourself.,0
"Iscon temple stands in a majestic grandeur. As you step in the chanting takes you into a calming mood. Even if you are not religious, walking through the temple premises is worth. Temple premises is kept clean and orderly. Finally there are great food counters awaiting you to fulfill your taste buds. Enjoy the visit.",1
I always visit the ISKON whenever I get frustrated or when I will be in Happy mood . One of the best place in Bangalore . must visit place.,1
Iskcon is located in West of chord road near to soap factory in Rajajinagar. It's a temple of lord Krishna. Every time there will be crowd in temple.,0
You will get all the peace you want here. Its near to railway station so can be covered on the way if travelling by train.,1
Very magnificent Temple of Lord Krishna. The Temple is modern with exquisite furnishings. The Temple has great decorations and huge hall for darshan. The Tim please having prasada stall with the so many items to relish. One of the very finest ISKCON temples in the world. Must visit for any tourist coming to Bangalore.,1
"I'm afraid to say it but this place of worship has been turned into a money making scheme. Once you have been through the main hall every turn leads you to another room in which they try to sell you more things. Don't get sucked in here, don't buy any extra tickets, don't get interested in buying any books or Krishna paraphernalia because once you've shown interest they will pounce.",1
"ISCON Temple is a place of attraction for tourists visiting Bengaluru.The nearest metro station is Mahalaxmi [walking distance].The temple is beautiful with beautiful idols of Radha &Lord Krishna.The place is neat & clean and nicely managed.Within the premises,the facilities,books,fast food,meals & gift shops are available.The prasad of khichdi is vey tasty & filling[It is free].",1
"I visited with my mom .
The place is nice but it can be better.
I loved the bhajans but the separate session when you pay extra is really bias in terms of a holy place .
Prashad is good but they can put up effort to give more varieties as per the money the organisation gets from all around the world .",1
"A beautiful, huge temple and I liked the 108 stones, you had to step on each stone and say the Maha Mantra before you could move to the next stone. Only after completing 108 times the mantra, you could enter the temple. It made one get more concentration and peace while waiting - what a great way to calm down from the hectic life outside! There was nice prasad for sale and a simple meal given also. Great place!",0
"It is a temple of Krishna where you can observe a peaceful environment and the people all over the world . You can get all types of vegetarian food , snacks and all .. and also you can get a lot of toys , books , things to buy ...",1
"A place to connect the physical world to the spiritual world. The whole complex is quite big and takes a while to cover all. Its located opposite to Metro station Mahalaxmi, and the connectivity makes it is a must visit spot for all. The temple complex has multiple temples dedicated to various dieties. The main part is a place of art where you see great paintings of Lord Krishna. Public facilities are available at various levels & has a good parking space too.",1
"This is not a temple, its a magnificent complex which takes you to a journey to make a connection with God in different forms. The place makes you feel really positive and special. The complex consists of wall carvings, sculptures and marble work that will definitely please you. The place feels extra special during late evening hours when the complex is lit up with beautiful lights. A deserving visit and a must recommend for everyone. Prefer evening hours to include prayers during your visit.",1
Peace full place and most of familys visited Saturday and Sunday and everything is good and place is top of small hii,1
"The temple complex is quite big and takes a while to cover all the ground. Though it's beautifully made it's a little risky during the rains as most of the time you are in the queue, you are exposed to the sky and the floor becomes quite slippery. Also, at the entrance we were sold premium fast track tickets although there were hardly any other people. We didn't ask for it, so I feel that was a little underhanded.",0
"This is more than a temple. This is a place of art where you see great paintings of krishna, get authentic wooden craft works, and great food in their resturant ""Higher taste"", There is a Function hall attaches if you want to host a celebration.",1
"Conveniently located opposite to Metro station Mahalaxmi, it is a must visit spot for all. Located at a hill top it surely gives a great view from below.
The property is well managed and proper system is followed for all devotees to take blessings.",1
"A large structure soon to be outdone by an even bigger version on the outskirts of Bengaluru. The purpose of the temple however confuses me, is it a place of worship or a means of extracting money from people. The automatic donation accepting ATM type machines, the crowd control barriers and the precious metal and jewelled covered statues all speak of wealth whilst outside on the streets beggars ask for money. I fully accept it does good works in feeding thousands of school children but the building and atmosphere perturbed me. Overall it is quite interesting but I came away confused and vaguely disturbed. Visit if you must.",1
"This is very good place to visit when you are in Bangluru.
This is Temple of Lord Krishna. you will feel blessed when you visit the place.

neatly managed. and also have Metro connectivity.

Thank you!",1
I will highly recommend to have a vist to this place. The super sound and calm ambiyence will make you feel like staying there forever and a awesome snack and sweets kitchen will add more to that. A must visit when you are with your family,1
"ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) is not a traditional temple like others. It is mostly for tourists (international especially) who would like to see a temple. The temple is clean and there are 2 small temples before you reach to main one. There is special entrance as well with some fees. Normal entry there are 2 ways, one is direct to temple and another one has 108 stone slabs where you chant ""Hare Krshna"" mantra 108 times and then enter.
Pros:
Its very clean and neat.
Well Organized.
Cons:
After you cross temple premises, it looks like shopping Mall. Trying to sell stuff in the name of Krishna.",1
The ISKON foundation's temple at Bengaluru is quite heart warming and a nice ambient place for pilgrims.,1
"ISKCON bengaluru temple is very organized. Parking is available. Evening time around 7 is best time to visit as aarti ritual is performed at this time with people singing and dancing on the music ""Hare rama hare krishna"". After this commercialization starts, accessories and food stalls. Items are good if one wish to buy otherwise it's not mandatory. As prasadam, they serve rice khichdi which is delicious and it is served after you are through the paid food stalls. After all this there is one restaurant called annakoot which primarily serves south indian dishes. Once I had food here and it's average. Overall it's a divine experience.",1
"The Iskcon temple is nothing else than a tourist trap where the Krishna loyal wants to influence you. I must be honest and say I really felt bad during the visit. I was forced to get blessed and prayed for, forced to walk thru several floors like in an IKEA wear-house and everywhere people trying to sell us Krishna books, paintings and much more. You can see that this Temple has a four star rating with Trip Advisor but notice that this is because of the Indian people rating high. Again, don't go there! So many better ways to enjoy Bengalore.",1
"What a place to be, after a hectic office day on your tour...an excellent experience ...stayed there till I felt really calm from inside!",1
"This was the place where one of my friends got married. Since it was a Tamil Brahmin wedding it was very early in the morning. The rituals began at around 7.30am!!
We friends escorted the groom to the rituals area and then set off to visit the temples.
There are 3 temples in the complex
1) Prahlada Narsimha
2) Srinivasa Govinda
3) Radha Krishna

The entire temple is a massive structure. It attracts tourists not only from bengaluru or India alone but from the world. Since we visited the temple early in the morning it was very less crowded. We could spend a good amount of time in the temple. It was a very divine and a peaceful experience.

Try getting into the temple early morning so as to avoid the long queues and get the most from your time with the supreme.",1
I felt so much of peace after I visited this temple as there is full of positive energy is present in surroundings of the temple.,1
"You've seen these Hindu missionaries all over the world. If you are in Bangaluru, do take the opportunity to visit their splendid temple there. Prayer services (puja) are mesmerizing. If you don't know what to do, the priests will advise you. An elevator makes this temple accessible to people in wheelchairs. If you are Indian you don't need to be told that ladies dress up in their finest saris to visit temples. If you are not, but feel comfortable in fancy Indian clothing, this is your chance to wear it. Guys have it easier. Most wear smart casual. I didn't know the dress code and turned up in jeans and a sweater. Nevertheless, I was treated with complete courtesy.

There is a series of stalls selling religious artifacts and vegetarian lunch is served to pilgrims. This means you, if you wish. Hare Krishna.",0
"This is very beer temple to visit, building structure 8s very amazing, love to see rituals activities, love to listen bhajana, was
Feeling like I'm in heaven.
Hare Krishna..hare Krishna..Krishna..krishna-hare hare.

Thanks",0
"While the temple is beautiful what I don't like is the fact that it is completely commercialised. You have to follow a line and a path where at each point they are selling something. For example, you can't walk down the stairs directly but in a convoluted way passing through a room where they are selling stuff. This bothers me.",1
"No where will you find such a peace and just by looking at the idol you would be mesmerized.
adding to that the place is very well maintained and super clean with directions and help all around.",1
This is very peaceful place. Connection from Lord Krishna. In evening and on holidays it is crowded. There is shops which sell everything from food to clothes.,1
Iskon temple in Bangalore is one of the famous temple in Bangalore. Must visit this temple whenever u go to Bangalore.,1
Feel relax. First time been der. Very nice place to visit and lot of craft exhibitions and historic monuments of past and even food nd beverage available. Had nice time in my visit,1
"We made the big donation amount to be able to use the VIP lines and STILL wound up having to go get cash from our driver (as we only had cards and paid a generous donation via card to visit) so that the ""shoe person"" could get his 3 rupees per pair of shoes. It's one of the things that disillusions me about many of the temples in India is that if you don't pay to have somebody watch your shoes, you wind up with a gigantic hassle (or stolen shoes). Generally not a fan of forced donations to visit temples, makes me less inclined to see them as actual spiritual places and more like a big business. Massive stalls and arrays of ""stuff"" to buy.",1
"Four of us visited ISKCON temple in Bangalore on 17th December 2018, by taking a tuk-tuk from the Hotel Meridien. We arrived in front of the temple around 10 o'clock in the morning. Although there were not many visitors at that time, arrangements are in place to accommodate a long queue. There is a place to keep your footwear before entry as well as a place for safekeeping your camera equipment. No photography is permitted within the temple. There is no fee for entry.
The temple is orderly, very clean and well maintained. The architecture is striking and is a combination of modern and traditional aesthetics. A prominent feature is a tall ‚Äì gold plated flag post. Though I am not a Hindu, I felt a feeling of piety and spirituality within the premises. The chanting of ‚ÄúHare Rama ‚Äì Hare Krishna‚Äù lifted me to a feeling of holiness.
ISKCON is the shorten form for International Society for Krihna CONsciousnes. ISKCON devotees worship god Krishna.
At the exit from the temple, but still within the temple premises, are many shops that sell items related to Krishna as well as souvenirs and food. We purchased the book English translation of ‚ÄúBhagawat Gita‚Äù here. This area also has a lecture room, exhibition area and a movie theatre showing Krishna related movies and documentaries. We left the temple at about 1125 after spending about one and half hours within the premises.",1
ISKON temple is one of the biggest temple for lord krishna in India. It is located in Rajaji nagar Bangalore.Every Hindus should see this temple.once you visited in temple people will get peace and lord krishna blessings.The construction of ISKON Temple is very nice.,0
You will not be disappointed at all... one of the best temples in Bangalore. Must do the whole climb right from the bottom seeing all the idols and temples on the way.,1
"Visited here on a Saturday afternoon & bought the cheapest pass for 500 IR. Had no idea it got us VIP access, past all the lines, a private blessing & front row access to everything. It was an interesting experience, but be prepared for a long exit through tons of gift/souvenir/book/food shops which are part of their fundraising efforts. I wish they allowed no flash/silent photography in the main temple. I would recommend it as long as you buy the pass, or you'll be waiting in line all day.",0
I like all ISKCON temples in India. It has so positive vibes. One can go with family and spend some time here.,0
"This temple is located on Chord road, rajaji nagar, Bangalore. Easily located being on the main road with prominent design. Google location & directions are accurate.

It gives a good feeling once you are inside the temple. It is ideal for religious visit with old & young. It takes about 2-3 hrs to have darsan & get exit from other side. At the end a good cafeteria & shopping counters are available. Overall a good place to visit to know culture & traditions of the country. A must for tourists visiting Bengaluru.",1
"I have been Many times to Iskcon Temple, its the best of best which i have seen, to go there u can catch many transport facilities, it's a white Building Beautifully made, I think I have seen few More Iskcon with same style of set. To go inside the temple feels Peace n calm, it's touch inner core when u listen
``Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna hare hare``
Apologies if wording were wrong. It's always says if you go temple please be seated for a while remember your God. Same way I have seated and it's help me to concentrate and I was feeling so greatness around,very relaxed, Calm.
On occasions the place is very busy and worldwide Devotees comes.
Best Place to be in to Remember once a while God.",1
Iskcon temple administration is excellent. It is very attractive. The prasadam is excellent. We get good gifts from the shops. The Lord Narasimha and Govinda Alangaram was excellent,0

``Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna hare hare``
Apologies if wording were wrong. It's always says if you go temple please be seated for a while remember your God. Same way I have seated and it's help me to concentrate and I was feeling so greatness around,very relaxed, Calm.
On occasions the place is very busy and worldwide Devotees comes.
Best Place to be in to Remember once a while God.",1
Iskcon temple administration is excellent. It is very attractive. The prasadam is excellent. We get good gifts from the shops. The Lord Narasimha and Govinda Alangaram was excellent,1

You will rub shoulders with Indian devotees of all ages and social groups here, get to taste wonderful South Indian dishes and walk around with bare feet at the same time! A must visit for first time visitors to India and to Bangalore!",1

"It's the most famous temple in the Bangalore area. It's crowded, but my American white male coworker got a specially treatment and I tagged along. We went through a different line, which is pretty much empty except 2 of us. BTW, I am American too, just not white :) Foreigners' ticket is a lot more expensive, but not expensive compare to US standard.",1
OK If you're bored on the weekend and have nothing better to do. Can't compete with the temples in and around New Delhi.,1
The first problem was our entry with my dslr camera which they didn't allow. It was unfortunately a festival day so we faced a huge queue. The temple complex seems more of a market place than a religious one. They did give some sweet prasad while we came to exit.,1
Iskon is the one of the holy place and its one of the famous temple in bangalore. Its a great place to go with family and friends.,1
"Iskcon temple is a wonderful and peaceful temple.This is the one of the famous temple of Bangalore.It is a temple with powerful and spiritual energy.

"Our First visit to Isckon, Bangalore has left us with extreme calmness in mind and made us feel pious. The entire place was very clean and vibrant. Display of Krishna souvenir and prasada attracted everyone. It's definitely a must visit place at Bangalore.",1
The temple is beautiful from the inside out. Well organised and very clean. For those who are not used to walking barefoot like me might find it a bit uncomfortable to have to take the whole temple tour with no shoes on but in the end it will be worth it :-),1
"ISKCON is not only temple for worship, it is a repository of Hindu culture and a social action oriented organisation that serves around 30,000,00 poor students of Karnataka/ other states a nutritious midday meal in their Akshaya Paathra Scheme. The temple is beautifully located on a hillock in central Bangalore and receives millions of devotees who have a wonderful darshan of the Lord and receive refreshments as prasadam.",1

"This temple was constructed on a hill specially selected to ensure Bangalore is protected from Negative energy and create positive vibrations. to Bangalore for progress..
Seems to be having the effect, .Bangalore has been fastest growing city in the world and also seen large expansion of economy.
Beside it is well built for organised crowd movement etc",1
"It is nice place to go once, or if you want to sit in quite place..go on weekdays before 12pm. If you like to eat healthy food, better you take your food with you. Otherwise lots of options for fried snacks and sweets",1
"What a remarkable Har Krishna Temple in Bangalore, India! On our drive to this great temple there were 7 cows who owned the road by crossing to the other side on their own sweet time! Cows are revered as sacred animals in this country and as I was patiently waiting, I thought how cool for these sacred cows to pass by as I'm on my way to the temple! When we arrived, we had to remove socks and shoes before entering. It does cost a small amount of money to enter, so my guide lead me all the way! I needed to wash my face, hands and feet! Then we began taking the steps up to the entrance. I counted each one. At different times we went into small areas to pray, as I watched and said my own prayers, I watched, then asked why he did certain movements such as hands, laying on the ground, placing his forehead on the wall, etc. My guide explained everything to me. I was curious about everything, but never minded me asking. We went up more steps, then more prayers. Then pictures of the outside of this beautiful building made if concrete, marble and gold! After the 120 step, we entered an amazingly large room with men and women in prayer giving respect. No pictures were allowed to be taken inside. So I refrained out of due respect. I saw Beautiful paintings, art in gold, and so many statues. We followed a line of people and I gave money as if I were in church giving my tigths to God. I received coupons at entrance to purchase a book, which was in English. They have in several languages. The book I chose to purchase was a vegetarian cookbook! After this we were given a spoon of water to drink. Then we went into other rooms like a small museum, gift shops, and foods to purchase. They gave as a gift some homemade desserts! At the final end, we were offered a free meal to eat. This was an amazing visit to learn and understand another's culture and religion. I felt very content when I left. Was extremely grateful for the guide I had. I recommend all open minded people to try learning different cultures and faiths and you can at this very beautiful ISKCON Temple! üôè",1
"First impression from outside is temple is nice and tidy.

Feel the temple is more of a commercial place than a devotional place.

One does not get a feel like you get visiting any other age old temple.",1
"Many many people for the Hare Krishna temple. Must follow the path which does not give time to appreciate the site as you are push by the crowd, and suddenly shops where you have much more time to spend....but not really the goal to visit the temple.
Interesting to see but too much commercial. Much better to spend type visiting the small Bull temple.
Tip No bag and/or camera allowed and if you wear short ensure that they are really below the knees",1
"On the one hand it was very interesting to see it and get a little familiar with the religion. However let's be honest here: it is not very traditional and very touristy. When you pay te premium fee, you will be treated better. This is not where the locals go. But still it was very nice to see it.",1
"This is one of the famous temples of Bengaluru.
We had visited in the evening.There was a big queue and had to wait for sometime to enter the main temple.
There are variety of shops related to spirituality.",1
"Took a US client for visit and he liked the place.
I dont prefer crowded places and that's me. The construction and architecture is impressive.",1

This is a internationally known KRISHNA temple in India. It is God Krishna's temple. Accommodation for pilgrims to stay is available. Clean & energizing temple. It is a temple with powerful spiritual energy.,1
One of the most clean temple you feel satisfied once you enter the temple I would tell everyone you should visit the temple with out fail,1
Great place for serenity and visualization of Lord Krishna. The chanting is a sure way of concentrating on Godliness. The prep activities for entering the temple and the organization of activities are lessons for management.,1
"There was too much crowd but the queue was moving continuously. Had a good darshan of Krishna and Radha. Bought a book ""Krishna "" in Tamil as books in all the languages were available.

Memorable new year 2019",1
Far beyond our expectations as tourists. This place is fairly new & frequented by large numbers of locals. Easy for a few hours to slip by. Food is provided for free & is a great experience,1
"Relatively modern temple and I recommend visiting early, to avoid the crowds. Worth a visit and if possible with a local. The food served at the temple is excellent",1
"Have been to this temple a few times and love it every time I visit. The path to reach main shrine, being there and finishing the visit with awesome snacks that you get there completes it. Hare Krishna!!",1

Center of the city and good to spend time with all pure peace",1
the main shrine is peaceful and one can have a good view of Bangalore city from the temple. There is an overkill of merchandise and food items on sale,1
"Please leverage the metro. Due to traffic pattern, alight @ Sandal factory station and take an auto. Way back, take the mahalaxmi station from the temple. If you have folks that need a shorter walk, then the auto can drop you @ top entrance, thereby reducing the steep climb. Another tip- if you want to cut queue and take a shorter route and also the closest line for darshan, buy a ticket ( 300 INR) for family. The ticket also gets a packet of prasad, 70 INR discount on books too. The entire complex is very clean and maintained well and radiates peace. Free food is available ( on way out) between 11.30 and 13 00 hrs everyday. Restaurant food is also available, for folks that prefer that. The entire way out is flanked both sides with commercials- both momentos and good. A MUST visit, when visiting Bangalore.",1

This temple is devoted to lord Krishna. The area covered by the temple is huge but it is very beautiful. If you reach on time you may see the morning or evening prayers performed by the priests there. they sing and dance to various Krishna songs and is a absolute delight to see it.,1

"If you go there are things you need to know - you have to wear long pants or they will make you wear and wraparound that is hard to walk in; and you will need to take your shoes and socks off for the entire tour process. No big deal, but you have to put them in a sack at the entrance to the grounds, they give you a numbered chip that you will need to get your shoes and socks back. Also you have the choice of ""Donating"" at the beginning (just before you take off your shoes) to move ahead of the lines and have the opportunity for personal prayers. I do recommend this and although you may donate as much as you want, 300R (~$4) gets you all the additional benefits. The lines can be really long; the day I was there, there were several schools attending and the lines were long.

Once inside the Temple, the monks (?) will pray for you several times. This makes it a very personal experience and is the key reason for the donation. The monks I was with were very kind and accommodating, I enjoyed the experience (even though I am a Christian).",1
"I have always wanted to this temple and got the chance beautiful Temple with lovely location and huge spacious grounds,the inside of the temple the Murtis and the Srinagar of Radha- Krishna did not wanted to move from there Beautiful,the best part is performing the Arti amazing every one seems to be in a different world.",1
Ita a really good temple were temple is very cleaned and maintained the place of water is too good and food over there is good and the prasada is very nice,1
"I visited Bangalore several times in past but never got the right opportunity to make a trip to this temple. So, this time when I visited, I made it a point that I must give this is a visit. And believe me, I feel so pleased and satisfied that I did not miss it this time. It is located a bit outskirt of Bangalore city center but easily connected by all modes of transportation, be it on your own or public transport. The passageway of entrance till up to the main temple is well managed to easily handle the peak load in a disciplined and queued manner. For devotees of Lord Krishna it is one of the destination. For others, it could be a recommended visit due to its spiritual flavor and the organized approach of allowing people to bestow their worship or offerings to the Lord Krishna. Besides the spiritual or religious aspect, this could still be considered as the lace where you could spend some quality time sitting idle and regrouping yourself internally gaining some peace of mind. Photography inside is strictly prohibited and it allows you time to spend without being distracted too much. I missed the evening Aarti due to time crunch, however, feel so pleased to visit this temple. There are plenty of food options available in the canteen at quite reasonable price. The bookshop has a rich collection of religious books in several languages including English. The souvenir shop has a plenty of options to buy decorative or gift items. It is highly recommended to visit early hours of the day to bypass the crowd of the mid-day, specially in case you are making a plan for a visit over the weekends or holidays.",1
"The temple is located next to the Narayana Nethralaya on West of Chord Road. The nearest metro station is MAHALAXMI. The temple is on a hill and one has to climb the stairs to reach a place where one can leave their footwear and get a token for the same. Then, one continues up the steps and goes through the main entrance, a favourite spot for selfies! Inside the main entrance is an open space where you may sit for a while. Then, the one enters the small temple and exits to climb the stairs to the main hall. The hall is very peaceful and the ceiling is very high. However, the sounds of prayers reverbate throughout the hall. Once one finishes praying before the deities, one may sit in the hall's designated sitting area and get immersed in the thoughts of the almighty.
After one finishes their prayer, one exits via another set of steps. All the entrances and exits are clearly marked by signposts. And, there are temple employees and volunteers to help if any information is required.
As one walks down the steps, one encounters various stalls of sweets, holy books and artifacts. If one wishes to purchase any item one can do so.
Now, people who come by vehicles have a separate entrance which takes them all the way up to the temple. And, for disabled people the temple offers assistance and lifts are available. Now, I cannot comment on how good the facilities are for disabled people as I did not see one being used by a disabled person. However, I did see a signpost for a disabled person toilet and some wheel chairs near the entrance.",1
This is one temple where architecture is pretty similar to other ISKON temples.Parking takes time on weekends and dont miss the aarthi here,1
The place is very good and filled with divine ambiance. The elevation of mandir also helps to enjoy cool breeze in evenings. A must visit.,1
"Not so much to see. Also at the entrance desk some guys select people to pay for the entrance while the others can pass without pay, very strange.",1
"Well structured and organized temple. One of a kind visiting experience. Apart from the main temple, there is plenty of stalls and other options for temple related shopping and knowledge experience. Books, idols and many gifts options are spread across many stalls. Refreshments are also available. You need not to worry about your footwear and bags too, as it all can be safely kept at the entrance at a very small charge.",1

The individual soul is an eternal personal identity which does not ultimately merge into any formless light or void as suggested by the monistic (Advaita) schools of Hinduism.",1

"One of the Best and must visit places in Bangalore. Best maintained. Very peaceful. Beautiful temple. Marvellous structures. One has to claim the steps to reach Krishna temple. Meanwhile you will come across shopping and food places. From top one can view the Bangalore city. Car parking available.

A nice monument. Extravagant building and decor. The good part os that it is airy and well lit compared to conventional temples. There is good parking space and provision to store footwear. It has some store to buy goodies and souvenirs if you want.
They do have a convention hall on the campus that can be rented out. Not meant to be a religious place for worship in my opinion, it's mainly a place of tourist attraction. Worth visiting to appreciate the structure and opulent interior.",1
We were very lucky because visting this temple we got the chance to assist to a special ceremony. I can't say if it is a regular one. It was a Friday evening. If you have opportinity to see if it will give you a peacefull feeling.,1

Jai shree Krishna",1

After darshan, one can have ‚Äòprasadam' either at the sale counters or free prasadam (full meal) which is served in the afternoon time. Lord Krishna, the presiding deity, attracts even a non believer of God, once he/she is there! We keep visiting this temple quite frequently. Recently, we participated in ‚ÄòDeepostava Celebrations' on one of the evenings of ‚ÄòKarthika' (November) month.",1

The temple is quite majestic and leads to devotional feeling and calm and peace in mind.
The Prasad served was also very good.
Will again visit the temple.",0
"Best time to go is early morning as its more peaceful
during that time. After Darshan , there's a great cafe to enjoy some good food.",1

It is definitely one of the best places to visit in Bangalore on a weekend with your family and friends.,1
"I visited this in Sept 18 as this was on pending list for sometime.. It was worth it.. There was big queue early in the morning itself.. but around 30mts it took to reach the main sanctum. On the way you will see Lord Narasimha & Venkateshwara statues ..pray and proceed further when you will enter a huge hall with beautiful ceiling paintings depicting life of Krishna. The gold statues are beautiful. There will be some bhajans always which is very soothing to ears. If you happen to visit on special days/ festival days, prepare for serpentine queues. The complex is huge with various sections and also there is a section where the free meals (akshaya pathra) is prepared and delivered free to all govt school children. You can donate for this noble cause there itself or online. Prasadam they give is delicious.. You can also buy photos/souvenirs and also sweets from the shops there. Parking is adequate but on special days, better to hire a taxi /auto instead of your own vehicle. Metro station is just 100 mts away.. better take metro (green line).",1
Visited there many times. Very well kept. The crowd and the long winding route are distracting. The staff also needs better grooming.,1

The idols are like the south Indian idols to keep the southern spirit. The mail hall is the most beautiful compared to rest of the Iskon temples of India. Specially the deeps hanging on upper floors makes it like ancient sculpture.
Golden color enhances the over all spirit of temple. The idols are also golden which is something different compared to rest.

Almost in the centre of the city with ease of connectivity to any point. Added attraction is Mateo station and a mall and Mysore Sandel soap factory nearby making you to earmark a full day for the visit. Main shrine is peaceful with rich decoration to the idols and the surrounding area has become highly commercial with variety of souvenirs tempting you to buy. Yet it is worth it. Be watchful on a rainy day as the marble floor would be slippery and you have to walk a long distance inside.,1
"Lets take a view of Iskcon temple lord Krishna located in Main Hall & the idol is really beautiful, but one thing which is sad part is that its become totally commercial centre, too much of crowd,",1

"This was an interesting experience overall, as we ventured through the path of this temple. At first it seemed less busy but before we knew it, there were loads of people behind us. It took some skill and patience to ensure that we made it through the tight and narrow channels, which made it quote an experience.

The architecture and prayer area was great, with loads of items for purchase in the stores. The food was good and a unique taste overall.",1

It was a great experience.",1
"The Iskon temple in Bengaluru is a place worth visiting. It is a big temple. From an architectural point of view, it is beautifully constructed. The interior of the main mandir is ornamentally decorated. The pandal (simhasan) on which the deities are worshiped is made of silver. I think, the upper portion of the pandal are gold plated, though I have not clarified about it. There was a large number of visitors/ devotees visiting the temple, but the crowd was being managed very well. The devotional songs/ bhajans sung inside the temple was making the whole atmosphere devotional and peaceful to the soul. The Prasad was tasty. On the whole, the ambience was very good and peaceful. If I come to Bengaluru again, I will definitely visit the temple again.",1
"This organisation is doing a great job to the community. Apart from trying to inculcate values in children and teens, they are providing free meals to school children. Its a very peaceful place, with great food/prasadam.",1

"If you are a tourist, planning to visit Bengaluru & listing out which are the must see places, you need to visit, when you are in Bengaluru, this Temple should & must be there, in your list, among top five.

Situated on the western part of Bengaluru, on one of the Ridges of the City wherein, the view of the City, from this Temple premises is fantastic.

The Temple premises has been maintained neat & clean and whenever you need any sort of help, there are fleet of volunteers, who are ready to assist you, with a smiling face.

After finishing the Darshan, one can quench their hunger, in any one of the food courts, which are situated in the very premises of the Temple wherein, one can taste varieties food items. Apart from the above there is also a well maintained restroom within the Temple premises.

Finally, when you are planning to visit Bengaluru, you program your tour itinerary in such a way that, you try to visit this Temple in the evening wherein, you can spend around two memorable hours in Bengaluru.",1
"very neat and clean temple with many shopping options with very systematic queue system.
photography is not allowed so stay away from clicking photos.",1
"No visit to Bangalore can be completed without visiting the famous ISKON Temple. Like the other ISKON Temples the deity is Krishna and similarly the sculpture is very beautiful. The place is usually crowded by the tourists and few locals too. As tourist you may end up spending a few hours to visit the temple. I strongly suggest to pay extra and go for Express Darshan"" to reduce the time but if you are free and want to have the total authentic experience, you can go by the regular route, where in one has to chant Lord Krishna's name at reach steps with total 108 times. One step at a time. They have very decent pure vegetarian, Satvic for served in a restaurant just behind the temple: ""Higher taste"".",0
"Its very well maintained, neat and clean place. You will feel peace here. There is a scope for some shopping too :-) also you can test some food items. Their Mysore pak was too good.",1

Loved being there as part of aarti too
üëçüèª",1
It is a nice temple but as we went on Janmashtami it was very crowded and we had to wait in queues for more than 2 hours,1
"Praise the lord, Hare Rama hare Rama, rama rama hare hare. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna hare hare. This is what all chant. This is the best temple I have ever seen personally",0
"The place has a nice ambiance, sanity and well maintained a spiritual presence of all the entities .............................",0
"Its a beautiful ISCKON temple in Bengaluru. Conveniently located on the main road. Parking is available.

Difficult to climb the stairs for elderly and people with babies as there are many.

But once you reach the top you feel worth. The aura of the place is mesmerising. We visited during evening aarti time and the way bhakts were dancing to the krishna songs was amazing.

The food court at the temple serves delicious savouries at reasonable prices. So after darshan one can actually feast at the food arena.",0
I was very impressed of this temple. Also the ticket you paye are used to pay food for people at scool that could not for them. I realy appreciate this.,1
"Entrance to the temple is free. I would certainly recommend taking a metro train to get to the temple and the temple only a quick 5mnts. walk from the ‚ÄòMahalakshmi' Metro station. The temple does not allow cameras inside but can store these in a secured place. You will need to remove your footwear before entering the premises and the temple arranges to stow them away within bags in a secured place. Once you go through the passageways, you enter the main part of the temple that has an attractive gold plated altar in which Krishna and Radha deities are installed. Keep an eye out for the huge and awesome painting on the ceiling. I visited the temple on a weekday and there was not much crowd. But allow an hour to complete the Darshan if you are taking the general line. After the Darshan is completed, you are allowed to walk down the steps leading to a areas that sell handicrafts, pastries and other bakery products.
The temple also offers free lunch services after the Darshan is completed. Overall, a great temple to visit.",1
"Good to visit in Bangalore, less crowded on weekdays. Bit of difficult to reach temple due to heavy traffic",1
Gives me peaceful and joyful life when I visit this temple outsiders of bangalore must visit this temple,1
"Interesting experience, and it is an ‚Äú experience‚Äù. For travelers/ tourists, pay the 500 rupees for the upgraded experience. This is a religious experience, and, while not of our religion, it is interesting to see the worshippers and to understand the significance for them.

The temple itself is quite nice, interesting to see, and is very well maintained and kept very clean.",1
"This Hindu temple is an example where you see giving everywhere. This temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna, but you will get a chance to offer prayers to the other deities too. Just a wonderful, calming experience.

The temple sits on some very expensive real estate and tries to generate money desperately needed to keep it going. The food sold in the temple is plain fantastic. I could eat here every day.

I would recommend a visit this temple. Don't miss the opportunity to buy and sample the sweets in the temple.",1
"Cleanest Temple , doesn't weeks like a temple too clean. Weekends are bit rush but moving Q, no need to wait for long",1

"very organize and clean, nice temple and easy to go around. You must follow the indications. At the end you can buy some books and items.",1
ISKON temple banglore is famous for its divinity and peacefulness. Statue of lord krishna is just awesome in the temple,1
"Iscon temple is very good temple and systematic management ..,.. I really suggest people who are not visited this temple please visit once",1
Its a massive complex built of Hare Krishna. I had an wonderful experience. The architecture is very good and grand,1
"We visited this place couple of months back with family. It's a good place to take a family. They will enjoy a lot. Place is very well maintained and organised also it's very silent. But some will feel like it's commercial place by the way the temple is designed. You will get many things as like shopping mall. But still it's worth a visit to get darshan of lord Krishna and Radha..
Happy Visiting",1
"The complex is fairly large, and there are a few smaller mandir before you reach the main hall. The car parks can be full - so, do alight at the main entrance - its easiest that way to retrieve slippers etc later. The main hall is really grand - with 3-4 kilos of gold adorning the pillars etc where the statues are kept. We went on a weekday, so the place was not hugely crowded, and we got decent darshan in a very short period of time (did not need to pay for the VIP passes). The snacks are good :) (and so are the restaurants, even though we did not eat there this time).",1
"How crowded and the rush the place is, you feel solace with the chants of Hare Krishna when you enter the mandir.

If you feel low and you need some beautiful energy, ISCKON is the best remedy to visit.",1
Such a wonderful view with pleasant wind . The place is very cool and we just enjoyed it. We can also go to Orion mall nearby !!,1
"Very nicely located at the hill top Hera Krishna temple in a very ideally located place nearer to key location near Rajajinagar ,Bangalore.Attracts all types of tourists providing organized Que system to accommodate with out much delay for their darshan.and good prsadam arrangements throughout the day. One should not miss this land mark as the same is included the local tourism trip list of varies Important sight seeing places of Bangalore.Tempie authorities also provides very good catering facilities and good shopping mall of various temple utenciles,Paintings Puja items and variety of deepas with electric connection.",1
You will get both experience in the same location. Starts of with spirituality and as soon as you come out of the temple after offfering prayers you will get to pass by lots of kiosk specific to ISKCON group as well as from some small vendors which is worth watching and most of the time buying some collectables.,1
This temple is maintaining the neatness from staring to end giving a clear instructions like leave foot wear not to throw things and even the ambience is awesome and serving food is so hygienic,0
A nice place with a completely spiritual aura. One can spend the entire day here. Must visit in Bangalore.,1
Iskcon temple is very neat and clean. Rules for not taking photographs is strictly followed. Prasadam is very tasty. But the place where it is located is crowdy. Totally we will go there and relax our mind peacefully,1
It was quick visit and I felt everage being there. Too much walk inside railing but found proper arrangements to handle big crowd and easy to view lord krishna's murti nerby distance.,0
"Its a temple of Lord Krishna.
Gets crowded most of the time.
Ok place to take your parents.
Avoid rush hours. Well maintained.",1
"I was excited to get to see the ISKCON temple, as I had seen an old temple out in the countryside and wanted to compare. Expect to remove your shoes, as is customary in Hindu temples. Wear long pants or a long skirt and make sure elbows are covered. They would not let me bring in my camera, which they found during a search of my bag; I explained that I would not be taking the camera out for use but they were steadfast. Our guide was able to take my bag to our vehicle; I didn't feel good about this, but did not want to leave it in the shoe-checking area. Interestingly, people inside the temple were snapping photos left and right with their cell phones, so I'm not sure why my camera would have been offensive. The temple has the dieties of Radha and Krishna, and is one of the largest ISKON temples in the world. They charge everyone to enter, even Hindus. A huge and ornate gold-plated altar area is the focal point once one has navigated through the passageways to enter the main part of the temple. On the way in, a Hindu chant to Hare Krishna is repeated 107 times. I want to be clear that all of this was fascinating. My issue is that there is apparently no limit on the number of people who may be admitted at once. This resulted in beyond sardine-like conditions for the 45 minutes it took to get inside. Surely this is a hazard in case of fire or other emergency. I am not used to having NO personal space whatsoever. To be crowded and mashed up next to strangers was disconcerting, to say the least. Everyone was orderly during this progression. When things turned for the worse was after a few minutes in the main section of the temple - people began to push, shove, and force their way to the exits. It was the most frightening experience of my life. If I had fallen down, I would have been crushed. This detracted from the experience for me and I cannot therefore recommend it to anyone. It was simply too dangerous.",0
"All those who plan to visit Bangalore, a visit is a must to ISKON, with the beautiful surroundings, malls and metro around. a place of visit to spend a beautiful evening.
You can also donate and become a member, yearly once they call you for a pooja, birthday or anniversary, and also with food.",0
"The temple is walking distance of about 15 minutes from Orion mall/Sheraton Bangalore.
It took about 30-40 minutes to walk through the temple (it was non crowd morning). The main hall is very beautiful, i think it will look better in the evening as the might light up all the oil lamps in the evening. If you are a Krishna follower you definitely need to visit this temple and there are lot of Krishna based souvenirs. A must visit if you are going to Bangalore.",0
"It is very well organised and within Bangalore. It has planned well and kept as per the standards.
Structure of temple helps to understand that it has been as same as other ISKON Temple.",1
"1. It is modern clean temple.
2. As is the case with most of the modern temples, it lacks spirituality. Any day, even not-so-clean ancient temples are far better.
3. There is chaos in parking. There is none to control it. People known to temple authorities violate parking rules. 6 tourist buses blocked the traffic for more than 20 minutes at the top of the hill; after 20 minutes, other vehicles were diverted to a different route. We were stuck in the temple and our driver had to drive to the main street. I was forced to walk down the hill in gravel road with injured toes.
4. Restaurant scene is equally chaotic.

It would be a wise decision to skip this temple during your Bangalore visit.",1

Very nice and maintained very well. We went with family and enjoyed the experience. The Prasadam is very nice too.,1
It is a seriously good temple... Inside in it there is small small temples are there . And they also have a small mini market inside the temple.,1
"I have been visiting this temple since my entry into Bangalore city, that is in 2001...this place really gives peace...one has to walk a lot before reaching the main temple...what I like the most in this temple are the 108 stones...u have to step on those stones and chant hare Rama hare Rama ...Rama Rama hare hare....one just forgets all the worries...then the idols in the main temple are so beautiful...once attended their kirtans which made me forget everything...the one thing which I don't like is little bit of commercialization..it's compulsory to walk thru the halls where they have lots of shops...they also give prasadams in different forms...all the sweets and chat items u can see here...
Also in the premises, u have annakuta restaurant and also a fine dining restaurant called the higher taste..which is very good for the families...it serves both ala carte and buffet...
So, according to me it's worth visiting ...to relieve ur self from the hectic life of Bangalore",1
"The visit was quite beautiful. The complex is huge and all the facilities are easily available, at no cost. Be it keeping the shoes, wearing dhoti, eating prasadam, etc. It is a soothing experience. Even the management is very good. Must visit for all.",1
Quaint little place near the hustle and bustle of the busy city that is Bangalore. Located atop a hill. Provides serenity and peacefulness.,1
"Its their Vegetarian Lunch & Dinner Buffet in their Restaurant that is the USP on this place. And during particular Hindu festivals the Menu caters to the cuisine theme wrt that Hindu festival.
The Starters and Main are good. Their Dessert section leaves a lot to be desired .",1
"I have heard several advices to go visit this temple atleast once.So, I finally decided to visit this temple two sunday's ago. I went with my family. First thing first, the shoe collection center is well maintained. From there, you have to take multiple steps to reach the main campus of the temple. There are several other gods to bow down to before reaching to the main God. I have to say - you can see the effort with which these gods are decorated. Beautiful !!

When you reach the main building, there is a sitting area for the people in the center and devotees have to walk beside them to come to the front to see the Radhe-Krishna , sitting in a gold-claded- temple like structure. There are donation boxes , here and there, if anyone is willing to.

The queue moves forward with ups and downs along with staircases with prasad shops, then, wooden artifacts, then varities of paintings, then clothes shops and then finally there is also an arrangement to have some decent amount of snacks - samosas,poliyogre, puffs, sweets, bhajjis etc.Drinking water is also available in bottles as well as in water containers. You move further ahead, you will get the prasad- we got khichdi. And, finally you come to the shoe center.

Please dont mind me saying - I was hoping much of a temple marvel like we have meenakshi temple of madurai, konark temple of orrissa etc. The reason being- I have heard alot about Iskcon temple.The temple is itself was restricted to very less space and the commercial shops occupied the most of spaces.

I am trying to portray what I felt about this temple visit. You should visit this temple atleast once if you are in Bangalore.",1
"It is one of the huge white marble Radha Krishna temple built in 3 stages. Hare Krishna mantra is chanted all along. There are volunteers to help , share the details of the ongoing programs. There are pure veg food stalls also.",1
"Bustling with people, this is one of the most visited ISKON temple in Bangalore. Do not miss dinning at the restaurant, it is pure vegetarian, economical and the food is delicious.",0
"Nice place to visit, but very crowded. Parking is a issue due to crowed. Costly but good restaurant at the back forgot the name but it has both buffet and a la carte.",1
"One of the best place to visit in Bangalore.
Very calm, peacefull and clean place and very well planned and managed.
It is one of the largest ISKCON temple in the world.
Special bhajans held in the evening every sunday with free entry, also they have a film show for children which cost ‚Çπ50.
Complete staff is very respectful and prasad with other food and snacks are quite tasty and good.
If you are in Bangalore, please go to this Temple and you will get that feel good factor.",0
One of the biggest Krishna temple in Bangalore constructed on a hill. It also has a restaurant and a mini market.,1
"It feels like, or perhaps it is, a Hare Krishna theme park with a huge maze of souvenir stalls. There is no insight to learn about culture or history. Wouldn't come here again.",1
"Must visit this place!!! This is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world. It stands on Hare Krishna Hill. There is a dress code and strictly no half pants or short skirts. Not to worry they do provide dhothi (long skirt) for Rs.520 and Rs.500 is refundable once you return it. Main temple is lord Krishna but inside there are three more temples. After visiting temples, you will lead to shops inside.They have a good collection of spiritual books, idols and food.",1
It really felt too shantii inside the temple. Lord krishna statues were too good. Pics were not allowed. So didnt took.,1
"One of the best tourist spot in Bangalore. Meticulously maintained with beautiful landscape.Lord Krishna temple at the top in a pleasant atmosphere, ideal place for meditation.variety of prasadams/eatables and shops selling Pooja articles adds tourist attraction. Toilets and other facilities worth mentioning.Wish all to have darshan and blessings of Lord Krishna.",1
"Must visit this place. They do have a dress code and strictly no half pants. But not to worry they do provide dhothi for Rs.520 and Rs.500 is refundable once you return dhothi. Main temple is lord Krishna but inside three more temples are there. Anytime, any season queue will be huge but Its a slow moving. So enjoy the place. Queue system is so well organized that you won't miss anything in the temple. After visiting god, you will lead to shops inside.They have a good collection of spiritual books, kurthas, idols etc. My favorite place after visiting god is their food stalls. You get best food there. Once you come out of the temple, you will get pongal prasadam. Whenever I visited this temple I got pongal so I really don't know whether they give any other prasadam. They also provide lunch as prasadam. Other than this this temple has a huge car parking( need to pay though), guest house and hotels. You can also reach this place through metro",1
This is one of the most famous and most visited landmark in Bangalore. ISCKON has temples all over world and mostly in all Indian metro cities. It is one of the most visited places by tourists. Good for a one time visit. You get to know the ISCKON way of things. Well managed. Good crowd management. Has parking as well. A mall is nearby and a metro station is nearby as well. Good connectivity.,1
"I don't call this as a temple, because of its appearance and highly commercial attitude in everything. It is a beautiful tourist place with wonderful food. A place which is immaculately clean, superb management of everything, right from parking to directions to queue system to darshan to book stall to everything. A highly professional team is managing all activities flawlessly.
There are two auditoriums for mid size marriage and reception functions.",0
"We have been recently at Bangalore ISKCON temple... But it's not like earlier temple which we have visited on 2011...

Noticed It's became more commercial... In entry gate INR 300/- for direct Darshan without Q.. ( Which is not at all require for Darshan).

And inside the temple we could see maximum area covered by shop's selling all stuffs ( Lord Krishna related).

And external view is completely changed due to top story building and metro..

Now there is no wow factor about temple.. Except main temple inside the where is main statue of lord Krishna..

It's my opinion...",1
"Amazing place of worship

View of Hanuman Temple is very good.

Chanting 108 time is soul touching

God at the Best",1
It is an amazing place where you can attain spirituality. You can just sit there in the main temple forever listening to the bhajans. Do not miss the govinda swami temple on the way before reaching the main temple. They have lot of books like the Bhagavad Gita which are good.,1
"One of the best places for worship in Bengaluru. Went along with my family and had a wondeful experience. The grandeur architecture as well beautiful idols of lord Krishna can be seen. The decorations in the interior are so rich and majestic that it will leave us awestruck. Glad that we went when the crowd was less and had a wonderful feel. The calmness made our minds so relieved, while we recieved the blessing of god. Food/snacks stalls are also available where tasty vegetarian food can be bought. There are also souvenir stores where one can buy things for their family/friends. I would recommend this as a must visit temple in Bengaluru.",1
The architecture is wonderful. They have good maintenance of premises and crowds are well managed. The cafeteria servers very good food. Its near to Metro station.,1
It s a spiritual place....very soul comforting...big lake there...sight seeing also there..gud places for taking selfies and photos...one of must see places..very very famous,1
"Visited this grand krishna temple on my visit to Bangalore,

It is a must visit when you in the city.

The temple
has huge campus
very good arrangements for devotees, (though many people visit it)
nice darshan, the god in such a beautiful clothes and accessories
Lot of shopping options, artistic decor, book etc
Food stalls inside temples serves you delicious varieties at reasonable cost",1
Not to miss this location as the temple is maintained very well. Lot of visitors during peak hours. Nice feeling while visiting.,1
"This is a must visit attraction in Bangalore for all tourists. Lot of prasadam varieties and wide range of books to choose from. Some may feel it is commercial. Hare Rama hare Rama, Rama Rama hare hare;hare Krishna hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna hare hare chanting gives lot of peacefulness.",1
Temple is extremely well maintained... A bhajan will be running in background. Marble idols of god and goddess could be seen. Darshan goes good because of systematic queue.,0
Bengaluru Iskon temple is must visit place you just get inner peace and see the beautiful temple with some gold carving. Good shopping and food stores as well inside,0
"highly spiritual,very clean and good temple. have to climb and go to the main temple,elderly people should kindly look into this. overall great experience and a great spiritual environment",1
The temple is very peaceful and system are very systematic there is no push ups as usually happens in all the temples one can enjoy there darshan of god and peaceful envoirment lovely food and drinks and holy literature Nd things galleries and lot more,1
I am usually not a temple person but ISCKON temple is a landmark in Bangalore. The best part its very clean and they just let you be and not much botheration from priests or other people around.,1
"Beautiful and very awesome experience.
Even we may visit this place as a break on weekends or holidays.
Its very beautiful place, awesome view from the top of this place.
Must visit !!!!",1
"We were at the ISCON Bengaluru in June 2018. The celebrations went off well. The wedding lunch was very good with a sumptuous well cooked meal and catered well.The rooms were simple but very clean, and well maintained",1
"Visited Isckon temple in the first week of July.If you are visiting Bengaluru, you must visit this well maintained and beautiful temple, preferably forenoon and on non- holidays/weekend to avail more time for ""darshan"" without waiting much.",1
"It is a very calm, quiet & peaceful temple. Walkable distance from sandal soap factory metro station. Very cleanly maintained.",1
"As in other cities, Iskon Blore is also cleanly maintained. U can enjoy food especially sweets, which are very tasty.",1
"Beautiful temple to visit. Located on a hill has a good view. Huge temple premise, clean and beautiful. Inside the temple will feel very calm and nice.",1
This temple is one of the beautiful Iskcon temples in India. It has various floors so if one needs to visit then choose to visit all sections in this temple. One can refer to their website for prayer timings. Wheel chair is available too and is recommended for people who cannot walk much.,1
The temple looks boring from outside. It is completly white unlike other smaller temples in the city. The main hall is very nice though. It is very decorated and colorfull.,1
"I thought it was great. We arrived at 6pm so the light was beginning to fade and the place began to shine. The chanting is hypnotic as you'd expect and even with the many many concession stands selling goods inside, you are left with a strangely serene feeling. Beware, no toilets until the end of the visit, near the exit. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 in all conscience. Also I could have bought tons at the stalls, very cheap prices.",1
Swamy Prapubatha Aim to feed the Poor and Feed Piet of Hare Rama Hare Krishna is a Cynosure.Blissful prayers Pujas & Dance !,1
The architecture is really beautiful. girls will have to wear traditional dresses over here if u don't have one u can get one for rent at cheap price but you will have to pay 500 rs security . Just go for worship and don't fall in trap of pandits (dakshina). and also don't buy gifts or sweats from shops inside temple they are way too expensive,1
"We visited this temple on a Sunday and it was busy but not crowded. The temple is very beautiful and relatively new, built in the late 1990's. Because it is an active temple, you must dress respectfully which mean covered shoulders for women and no shorts for men. If you are only coming for sightseeing, you really only need to buy the 300 INR ticket. Higher priced tickets include other things like books. There was surprisingly quite a bit of commercial enterprise going on as you walk through the different parts of the complex.",1
"This temple is basically a commercial zone attacking people on the name of God for its own benefits . However upto certain extent religion is also taken care of with chanting of Vasudevaya Mantra and Prasadam distribution , Well a lot of improvement is required for religious sentiments of people there are other places for commercial needs for shopping or business , here almost every thing is sold , a temple like this must need to ensure the same and not to disappoint religious devotees",1
more business oriented than temple. needs more cleanliness n to be charitable. things need to be improved a lot,1
Temple is good but the thing which i dint like was commercialism of this place. they have kind of market to sell everything including prasad.,1
"Beautiful temple. more inviting and informational for tourists than other temples. you're guided on how to move through in case you don't know which is nice. their are people on the inside that also communicate with you what is going on and teach you the mantra. they souvenirs area is a bit too much. Also, like the area that shows you the evolution of how this temple came to be and its purpose. Good temple to start out with first.",0
The iskon temple in Bangalore is worth seeing.more devotional and each stepeu enter into temple u chant the vedic mantra. Peace of mind available here.,1
Prasadam here is the best part. Temple is very neat and clean. The Food Court has a wide range of delicious snacks and meal options. It gets really crowded over the weekend.,1
"ISKCON is a much visit temple for anybody. This marvellous Temple is neat and clean and well managed. There are three levels which one need to cross to visit the main shrine. Apart from this, there are lot of vegetarian food stalls which dish out delicious food. I highly recommend their fine dining outlet called Higher Taste which provides satwik Food.",1
"A must visit in Bengaluru is this beautiful, majestic, Iskon temple! It is a place that brings you peace, divinity and you leave feeling revitalised. It has great energy, positivity andis full of divine energy. The Iskon temple in Bengaluru definitely makes you believe in yourself once again.",1
"a nice place to spend some peaceful time and meditate. it was crowded when i visited, but it may be better during weekdays.",0
What a beautiful temple it is to visit. Located near yesvantpur station. Orion mall is beside this temple. This temple is so beautifully designed that you will go there multiple times. Hare Krishna mantras are used. Cameras are not allowed. Bags are stored. You have to enter there in que. Prasad is there. If hunger then go to canteen. It's canteen is good. Some escon products are also there to purchase,1
"Beautiful temple on the main road. Though it was crowded queue management is good. They have counters for sales of books, cd's, prasad as well as variety in food to satisfy everyone.",1
"It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world. Hare Krishna Hill is the hillock on which this temple is situated. During weekends and public holidays, Temple timings are 4:15 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. without any break in the afternoon.
The evening arati starts at 7:00 p.m. where devotees sing kirtan. In the main temple, the arati is performed by three priests. This arati is followed again by kirtan where devotees can be seen dancing to the rhythm of ""Hare Krishna Hare Rama"". The exit way after the Darshan from the main temple leads through a series of shops that offer books on Sri Krishna in all the possible Indian languages.",1
"Crowded but very beautiful to see the god, a surprise for new comers. Commuting is very difficult unless you have your own vehicle. Good time to visit is at sunset if they own the east door you can sun rises inside the temple, I went so many times for that view but only twice able to see it.

If you are going by bangalore metro get down at soap factory station its near-by you can also cover Orion mall which in walkable distance its also very good scenic place sit out area is very good.",1
"Even if you are not a temple goer, irrespective of your faith, this is an experience one should not miss. It is one of the best managed iskcon temples and a pleasure to be there. Make sure that you are reasonably hungry and enjoy the gastronomic treat at the end of the visit",1
"Once you reach this beautiful temple you are stunned by its beautiful construction. When you enter the temple a new kind of energy rejuvenates you.It is highly organised and maintained.One can purchase good products.Sandal agarbatti is worth buying.One can also buy sweets and various food products like pakode,lassi, dhokla and bakery products too.I was unable to resist myself for eating it's wonderful khichdi prasad.",1
It's a lord krishna conscious temple in bangalore. Nice temple. Modern temple. I feel really peace of mind here after spending an hour here.,1
This is one of the famous Lord Krishna temple located near Yeshwantpur this is one of the tourist place in Bangalore parking facility available very nice place and have some spiritual strength,1
"The temple is a best place to visit when you are in Bangalore. The coolness and city view around the temple is something you will love it. This Radha Krishna temple is really beautiful and if you visit in evening then you will love the bhajans, prayers being offered in temple. The small canteens outside temple are also a great things to try some snacks in evening. The place will give you calmness and soothing feeling in your life.",1
"Every sunday, they have a three hour long pooja, fun and dance. I was totally taken over. While entering, with water flowing underneath, you are chanting hare krishna... Just out of this world.",1
"Huge rush in Sunday N Saturday.. Best place to Relax, hang out with family üë™ friends, children üö∏ easily can spend 2-3 hours here.",1
Visited the temple in the evening with the family. It was very nice place n pleasant surprise to see that. Very good construction happy to visit again.,1
Wen i was in bangalore i used to every Weekend It's feels very peaceful n blissful there have to visit once.,1
We went to the ISCON temple in the evening in Bengaluru during our short visit. We witnessed the aarati.,0
"I had high hopes before visiting this place, hope for peace, serenity...SPIRITUALITY
But all and all gone to toss for tourism and materialism ‚Ä¶
When we can offer money and be close to KRISHNA (or HIS alter in the temple) then what are we promoting?
Are we not indirectly telling materialism is imp ( money )
All along what I read and heard ISKCON did not have biasing of religion, caste , creed and promoted equality for all who wants to be close to KRSNA , but not here, you can pay (300/- per family max 6 ppl) and can be in express line. It was ok till this point, but people who pay were allowed to have darshan more closely, and who did not pay were allowed to have it from a distant.
The sanyasis or people who were managing the crowd or people were bit rude and felt they were on duty and not SERVICE.
The articles sold in shops are costlier than other ISKCON temples, even ISKCON books, why ? And so is the FOOD .
The best thing of visiting and temple is, that while entering temple, you have to chant while stepping on steps, that was so ecstatic..
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare",1
I have been to this place around few years back & found it peaceful. The temple also has a shopping complex.,1
On weekends this temple use to be crowded so you have to wait in queue otherwise you can opt for special entry tickets. only thing i didn't liked was exit as unnecessarily you have to cross the shops and it will take 1 to 2 hours for exit in crowd. if with kids they can demand multiple things to buy so you have to handle them as well,1
"Firstly, this temple is really clean compared to many hindu temples. Quietness is much appreciated as few of them were meditating. Serene feeling, beautiful idols, very systematically planned signages displayed for new comers when they congregate for worship. I lovethis placevery much.",1
This place is beautiful usually crowded and to park your vehicles is pretty tough especially on weekends. Surrounded by buildings.Decent,1
I visited this place with some f my friends. It is recommended for any believer and is best seen in the nights.,1
"ISCKON temple is one of its kind of temple at Bangalore where we get to the main diety in a special manner which open up the inner beauty and helps in relieving all our anxiety and makes us very much relaxed.
The place is a must visit for anyone visiting Bangalore.",1
"Do not miss having Sri Krishna Pradam. There are stalls of delicious sweets and bhajis priced reasonably
Prefer visiting at night to see the ligting. Check for timings on the internet. Gates close at exact closing timings .",1
A temple crafted very beautifully but loads of restrictions. The main temple is very peaceful and well displayed. You can use Paytm to donate üòä,1
"It was my 10th visit to iskcon temple, Bangalore. Somehow I like this modern temple. Now metro connectivity is also there. Sunday will be crowded. But excellent facilities they provide, so no issue. Half day can easily be spent here.",0
"This is not temple but business premises. In the middle of concrete jungle. Very tough to park two/four wheelers. On hot day, it will be hell to inside. Has very good Bangalore metro access. Lot of noise around the entire location. Somehow this places has been famous. In most of the days, expect lot of tourist crowd. If you are looking for a peaceful, divine temple, this is not the right place.",1
"This temple which is related to Hare Krishna is worth a visit.
Especially in evenings time when it is lighted. In the complex there are also market stands where sweets and souvenirs can be bought.",1
"ISKCON temple in Rajajinagar Bangalore is a must to visit place for all travellers. The temple is located in the west part of Banglaore and is accessable through taxis, buses and autos. There is a Metro Station just opposite the temple which is an added advantage. There is plenty of parking which is a boon in horrible Bangalore Traffic. The temple has a very good resturant which serves sathvik food and other delicacies.
The temple is lit with colourful lights in the evening and this is a treat to the eyes!",1
"The architecture of the temple is very good you will impress with that and garden area is very clean and attractive and you will get some holly books also for sale inside the temple, they wont allow camera inside the temple be careful with that.",1
"Being ISKCON is like you live all your worries and be with God.
The atmosphere and the calmness feel you happy.
I will suggest at least we should go once a week there. We can see the difference in our self.",1
I would recommend you to go this place if you visit Bangalore. The temple contain 3 layers and each contain different god. The temple's very beautiful and I believed this is good place to pray due to many Indian people come and Its always crowded. I wouldn't recommend to carry camera or bag with you as you need to deposit before enter the temple and the deposit place look a little unsafe. Photograph's not allowed inside. Please ware appropriate shirt and don't ware short.,1
"A very well maintained temple. With chantings of Hare Krishna, Hare Rama and bhajans, one would feel spiritual. If you are in Bangalore on a spiritual tour, this is a must visit.

Situated to the western of Chord Road on the hill lock known as 'Hare Krishna Hill', Iskcon Temple is known not only for its religious significance but also for its architectural beauty. Also known as Hare Krishna this temple has been built in the Neo-Classical style, presenting a beautiful fusion of ultra-contemporary and traditional style and is equipped with all kinds of modern amenities. Like various other Iskcon temples which are spread all across the world, this temple of Bangalore is also dedicated to the Lord Krishna and Radha.
A gold-plated pillar named as dhvaja-sthamba (56 ft tall) is located at the entrance of the temple. Hari-nam mantapa, the place where people chant the name of Lord Krishna for the purification of mind, soul and world peace is located near the sthamba. There are 108 steps on each side of the mantapa and at every single step devotees chant the Hare Krishna mantra once. The steps will lead the visitors to the temple of Prahlada Narasimha which is guarded by Jaya and Vijaya, the two door-keepers of the Lord. Next mandir is of Sri Srinivasa Govinda and then comes the main temple where the deities of Sri Sri Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Sri Krishna Balarama and Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga are worshipped.

At the exit of the temple, there are various stalls which sell religious artifacts. Visitors can watch an episode of the Little Krishna Animation Movie (around 20 min. duration) in the Animation Theatre. At the Gita counter, one can have a look at the display of books written by Srila Prabhupada (the founder of ISKCON Bangalore) which is available in English and most of the Indian languages. The delicious Sri Krishna prasadam is distributed freely to all the visitors during the darshan hours. Other places worth visiting includes:

Dakshinakrti (the handicraft section),
Dharani (the organic food outlet),
The Higher Taste food court (which offers varieties of delicious sattvik food) and
Annakuta Restaurant.",1
Situated in a very big area.... this ISKON temple is one of must visit @ Bangalore.....Woy may feel divine experience with lots of peace in main hall area.... to reach main hall area will take time due to crowd... Holy chants and bhajans will retreat your inner soul.,1
Its a blissful experience to be there. Its a beautiful place with a beautiful view of the city and lord Krishna,1
"A divine treat, full of good vibes. Exclusive darshans by payment. Holy chants and bhajans to treat your soul. No photography. Chant Hare Rama Hare Krishna to lift your soul.",1
"I went with my friend to the temple, huge crowds, too much restrictions on camera and the security handled my camera very badly. Also the sanctum is a total show off, not at all a place of inner peace which temples are meant to be. Near the fountains the view was good and a comparatively better place, ""prasad"" was free and tasty. Another thing i disliked is the souvenirs shops (numerous ones) inside the temple complex which gives the feeling of a market-place and not of a temple.",0
"When you think of a temple, you think of a peaceful place. My experience at ISKCON Bangalore was not at all like that.
Though I would like to mention at the start itself that the temple is really beautiful, especially the main complex. Its a spacious hall with a ceiling covered in paintings depicting scenes from the life of God Krishna. God statues are surrounded by a panelling done in gold. Its quite spectacular.

The area is roped and divisions are created in such a way that you get to visit the complete complex without missing out on any space. However, when we got to ISKCON, there was a huge huge crowd. This meant that we had to go through the complete complex in line, waiting behind this crowd, with sun beating down on us. Sometimes this line goes through places that you may want to skip on (like areas where goods are being sold), but have to visit anyhow.

Also, what I felt did not belong in a temple or maybe in a separate area/complex, was the over commercialised selling of everything you can think of!
From laptop bags, books, clothes, samosas, puffs and what not! I felt it takes away from the ""non-materialistic"" vibes that people come to Temples for.

I would not go there again. May as well meditate or pray at home.",1
It is one of the best sacred spot. You get a lot of positive energy as you enter the place. You feel energized as you go inside. And one of the best prasadam you get in this temple.You must visit this temple..,1
"Wow what a temple. Serene and perfect ambiance. The place makes you feel religious and humble.

The statue of the presiding deity is awesome.

Clean and pious atmosphere makes you calm.

Prasad too is great.

The only drawback is that parking vehicle is difficult. Better to take a cab and go.",1
Very peaceful and godly place to visit for people from any community. If you do not want to get lost in huge crowd then try to visit in weekdays where less devotes would visit unlike weekends or special occasion. Overall best and Divine!,1
The ISCON Temple is a fantastic place. The set up is beautiful and the energy is very positive. Be sure to wear appropriate clothes for it(men and women).,1
"Iskon temple, A peaceful place, where i went many time, when i studied in bangalore, great experience.",1
very nice but overcrowded temple. it's really wise to invest some rupies for the fast-bypass-ticket. thousands of waiting people can easily be bypassed that way. it's hard to resist the commercial aura of that temple ... you can spend a fortune on sweets and merchandise if you want to.,1
It's one of the biggest iskon temple. Parking facility provided by temple. Food plaza also available in the premises.,0
"This temple is too populated by tourists to be able to enjoy it. You feel pushed through the whole time and can't really stop and watch the service nor appreciate the architecture for too long. Still, I'd tell my friends to visit.

Note: No cameras, shoes, or bags inside. Long pants required.",1
I have gone number of times to this temple with my family and friends .it was so enjoying.in this temple main god is.,1
"Being a member we can also stay but we had one day time on our way to nysore we visited the temple , good discipline , cleanness maintain , good system for tourists for taking care of there shoes and baggage, VIP and prasad lines different, lord Krishna and Radha temple in gold awesome , too much peace, many things to buy from there shops, variety of food to eat .
Do not miss it had good time need almost 1 hr to see temple.parking available",1
This is a soo.dedicated place... The built was appealing and attractive.its sooo Beautiful.. MAny of my.friends are first time came here Loved this place a lot.its pakka peace and The neatness is 99.9% great,0
For many this temple might seem modern and might not seem to invoke the devotion that traditional temples would invoke. It might not invoke devotion but I think it helps invoke some kind of spirituality. IMO devotion and spirituality is different . The 101 steps where one needs to chant Hare Krishna for every step definitely does invoke a blissful feeling. Chanting and just forgetting yourself to the rhythm of the bhajans does make a difference to your spiritual mind. Try it!!,1
"Beautiful temple . really loved spending time here .Chanting name of god to eating , everything is really amazing here . I have never seen such a huge variety of food in one place .",1
There were two of us only and we been the only European guys among thousends of people. Impressive size impressive feeling.,1
this Temple is really Big. Must visiting Place in Bangalore. you will bless by god and peace in life,1
"a must visit, they are some places listed in the Indian tourist guides of Banglore that you can total skip since you will not get any different or better of the places at home or visited before, but this temple is a great place to visit and even helpful to get away from the city traffic and noises, and spend your time here charging the good vibes!",1
"Temple is very nice and peaceful atmosphre. Meditation and chanting hare ram hare ram ram ram hare hare...hare Krishna hare Krishna Krishna Krishna hare hare for 108 times before entering the temple is really awesome you feel very happy.,..",1
"I have seen every artistic painting painted on the wall inside the temple which really replicated the janma of Krishna and his play over Brindavan.
Thank you management for the design and maintenance of such a holy temple.",1
I am not much of spiritual type but i like visiting new places. i visited this last month. If you are going to get some god visit wali feeling then u will be dissappointed. Its more of a corporate temple business wali feeling. But it has prime location. Nice architecture some rocks and all. Free lunches. You can visit once. Although i liked the place but may be i am not much into god and all may be i didnt felt myself connected to the temple.,1
"This is one of the staple place in Bangalore for visiting business expats trying to catch a glimpse of Indian culture during their busy schedule at the IT capital. The temple is situated on top of a small hill. So there is this little climb from the entrance to it's sanctum sanctorum. On the way one can visit a few other smaller shrines and deities. In the main hall the Indian Hindu divine figures of Lord Krishna and Goddess Radha adorn in different forms. There are live prayers / bhajans (divine songs) offered from time to time.

On way out, one must pass through the food court and merchandise area should one wants to indulge in little bit shopping or eating. At the exit the temple staff offers prasadam (a delicious dollop of rice and lentils, or the khichri).

At the entrance (which comes also at the exit), one must deposit his/her footwear, to be collected while leaving. The early morning and evenings the surroundings create a great vibes for someone to spend some peaceful time.

The temple is now easily approachable via metro route.",1

If you want to find God this is a place",1
"Must visit if u r in bangalore. Huge temple with calmness. If you are visiting please go through 101 hare Rama Hare Krishna chanting steps which is heavenly and u will feel relaxed. On the way out of the temple, u have lot of eateries which serve all kinds of food items which I don't like the taste personally. You can try tough.ypu require A half a day to visit this place.",1
"ISKCON has become a huge tourist attraction from the past couple of years. The package tours have included this temple as one of the most go tourist attractions.
The temple as usual has timings 7am to 12pm and 4pm to 8pm so please be sure about the time.
It is overcrowded sometimes but the crowd is well managed. It also has some options for food, which you can try. The goodies sold here are quit expensive and hence I would advice against buying them.",1
"Temple is really big and nicely maintained..
There are 108steps (square boxes) on every square you have to chant ‚Äúhare Rama Hare Krishna Hare Krishna hare hare‚Äù then you can step on to the next square that's how you go inside .. Its good I really appreciate it but I would say it shouldn't be MANDATORY .. being religious doesn't mean one should follow-everything blindly .. some people might have less time and they just want to visit the temple in short time but this activity makes it time taking I found it sort of forced religiousness..

It should be optional..

Rest everything is nice and Its very peaceful ..",1
"Peaceful, rejoicing and heart warming temple. The gold architecture is stunning. No matter you're a believer or an atheist you're assured to come out with a soothing smile! If you're in the city please do visit. There are commercial vibes but the charity ""Akshaya Pathra"" is the best thing they are doing for the society. Hence one would not mind buying something there.",1
"Simple its modern temple. Having all facilities. Allowing mobiles .
There is 108steps each step we want say hare Rama hare Rama hare Krishna hare Krishna.",1
When I visited first time I was surprised to see such a big temple. The management is the key to this temple.,1
One can visit this place in weekends for a relaxed occasion. Very clean and quiet place. Very good ambience.,0
"We visited the tempel and took place in the ceremonies. The Tempel is an inspirational environment and the people welcome you.

I was wearing short trousers when I entered was handed a tradional skirtso that I was allowed to enter",1
"I have been to ISKON temple on multiple occasions and time-slots. Best time is to be available for the evening aarti during weekends.
Hare-Rama Hare-Krishna chants fillup the ambience and help the soul to calm down after hectic work days. The prasad after the darshan in blissful and satisfies the pallet.",1
"Beautifully structure, easy-to-access, worth a visit
It is quite an experience to climb the steps to different levels of darshan
On the topmost level, you will see statues of Si Krishna, Balaram and Subhatra - they look lovely.
This is a well-attractive tourist spot and has very good facilities for tourists.
Cons:
After darshan, you are redirected to a longer path, compelled to pass through shops and goodies - Allowed to choose, I would have avoided this route.",1
I have been to ESCON temple thrice and every time it gives me a different experience. The chanting of HARE RAMA HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA HARE HARE soothes my soul. I took my mom n my mother in law there n they were really happy. If u r in Bangalore u must visit this temple to witness the mesmerizing beauty of the temple n never lasting experience.,1
"This is one of the biggest ISKCON temples in India. Best organised right from entry till exit. For elders, it'd be a long walk and climb up a hill. I say hill as it's constructed over a hill , remains of which can be seen from a particular point.
The entry is to keep your shoes/sandles . Then you get along the way which is strictly a single person line till entrance of temple. The temple door is huge and view at evening is amazing . You can't click photos anywhere after this point. If you try to do so, be ready for a shout from the security guard. ;)
Then comes nrusinhma temple on the way. The main temple is HUGE! the lights , ornaments and the Chandanam(sandal) smell will be in the atmosphere. There are murtis of Lord Krishna, Lord balram and poojas are carried out at specific times.
The hall in front is very big and some bhajans will be presented by devotee groups there.
After darshan, there is book stall where you can purchase books related to philosophy, religion etc.
There are presentation hall and shops afterwards on a separate floor to purchase different things. Food stalls are everywhere on the way. They are bit expensive but tasty.
At the end, you get prasadam and then exit .
Must visit place while you're in Bengaluru. Go in evening time or early morning !",1
I went to ISKCON Temple. ISKCON Temple is known for its activities of engagement involving ardent devotees of Lord Krishna. The temple enrols members for life and arranges programs in their community centres for Krishna consciousness and awareness of the Lord. It is great place to go.,1
"Very beautiful temple, it must be best temple among all Iskon temple. It is must go place if you are visting Bengaluru.",1
"The ISKCON Temple at Bengaluru is probably one of the grandest Krishna temples in India, if not in the world. It is a relatively modern temple whose construction was started in 1990 and completed in 1997. It was built by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness founded by the spiritual teacher Srila Prabhupada.

We visited the temple one weekday evening and had to wait till 4.15 pm when the temple opens for evening worship. We had to wait in a long queue after depositing our footwear at the counter and paying a fee of Rs.2 per pair. The queue was orderly even though everyone was eager to enter the sanctum. There are wash basins to wash your hands and face, as well as water sprays on the steps so that your feet also get washed before entering. The steps were lined with steel railings all the way to the sanctum sanctorum.

As we went up we first entered two smaller temples dedicated to Hanuman and Garuda and Narasimha, and the next one to Sri Srinavasa Govinda. The presiding deities in the sanctum were Sri Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Krishna Balarama and Sri Nitai Gauranga. The sanctum is very well decorated and brightly lit, with the pujas and aartis being performed by a dedicated team of priests. There was enough space in the hall for devotees to sit for a while and soak in the spirituality. We paid our respects and moved ahead.

The next few rooms had some life-like statues of Srila Prabhupada, and some exhibits from spiritual life. There was one exhibit showing the various stages in a person's life from birth to death and how the cycle is completed. After this were many rooms displaying various items for sales starting from prasadam, incense sticks, pictures and idols of deities, and going on to decorative notebooks, artefacts and snack foods. At the final exit we received free hot prasadam in a dry leaf cup.

On weekdays the temple is open for devotees from 7.15 am to 1 pm and 4.15 pm to 8.20 pm. On weekends and public holidays it is open from 7.15 am to 8.30 pm, but keep in mind that it is bound to be more crowded on these days, as well as some festival days. One should be dressed modestly, befitting a place of worship. Besides a small purse, you are not permitted to carry anything else inside; and lockers are available to deposit your stuff.

Special passes are available for a fee, if you do not have the time and patience to wait in the general queue. Parking space is available inside the temple compound.

It is definitely worth a visit for everyone, whether you are a Lord Krishna devotee or not. You may even become a believer if you are borderline agnostic, and start following the teachings of Lord Krishna and the Bhagavad-Gita.",1
"I loved the temple,very hygiene and sometimes there will be long queue but worth waiting!Even the Prasada was awesome and tasty!",1
"This is located near Metro Railway Station. Ususally on Festivals this temple will be crowded. The temple has three levels each level one avatara. the Last one has krishna, balaram. There is also canteen inside and parking facility available.",0
"Located on a hill very close to Orion mall, very peaceful surroundings despite being in the middle of the city. It's better to go in the evening as there is a bit of bare foot walking and decent clothes.",1
"Hare Krishna Hill is the hillock on which this temple is situated. ISKCON Bangalore is a charitable society with the objective of propagating Krishna Consciousness all over the world, as explained by Srila Prabhupada, whose teachings are based on Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam.",1
"very vast and decent place. glamorous style with golden covered inner main temple of Shri Radha Krishna , Krishna - Balaram and Nitai Swamy. When you enter the main temple lobby , you get a divine feeling and aroma spread there is very different from the general one. One must visit at least once if happen to be in Bangalore.",1
Visited during my stay in Bangalore and it was a gorgeous temple. Please note: do not wear shorts/short skirts or sleeveless tops as you will need to rent something to cover up. Also you will walk barefoot so be prepared.,1
"visited the temple with family in april 2018 .. lovely architecture and well maintained temple .. there are steps to be climbed with smaller temples in between before reaching the main temple location which has 3 sections - krishna balaram , radha krishna & nitya gaurang .. for those who cant climb the steps, there is a lift which takes you straight to the main temple location .. also, a sitting statue of the founder of isckon temples is seen at the main temple location at the top .. on the roof dome, images & depictions of the life of lord krishna are seen .. the pictorial depiction of lord krishna are seen at many locations in the temple .. there are sweet stalls at different location of the temple .. also different souvenirs could be purchased at very reasonable rates .. these include images and idols of lord krishna, religious books relating mainly to lord krishna, agarbatties, garlands, kurtas, shirts, T-shirts, bags, toys for children , etc. from 1130 hrs the free meals scheme begins .. there is also an alternate canteen where food could be purchased .. in the main temple location one could sit and meditate for some time .. chants of lord krishna are played by musicians at the location .. there's a pond at the temple which looks beautiful and is well maintained .. overall its an awesome atmosphere ..",1
"This is one of the best temples in South India.
Just be careful with many people around trying to get your money.
Best thing to do is do with some locals if you know one.
Do not accept any help or free stuff because at the end to the visit they will charge you too much for those items.
Nice places just be careful when you are there.",0
"A temple sit royally on a hill top and constructed with neorich architecture of gothic + Aagama blend shines the shrine face in royal. A system of chanting 108 times of RAMA KRISHNA MANTHRA by default after crossing 108 foot pedestals is a memorable experience. Highly descipliend volunteers,hygiene serene ambient and devotioanl atmosphere are positive attributes of this place. Sanctum sanctorum mesmerizes every body with the virtue of its high top ceilings and over roof paintings.Reasonably priced various items for souvenirs, mini screen exibits KALIYA MARDANA animated film, vedic coffee taste of restaurant are to be experienced. I have visited ISKCON temples of Mayapur (WB), Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad (both Abids / Secbad) Pune (both camp& Kothrud) and Ahemdabad. But this banglore temple looks with some commercial business touch like special darshan rs 300/- , rituals ranging from 500-1500 etc are self explanatory",1
"This is not a traditional temple, it is a tad bit different. In case you are looking for a divine and self-exploring journey then take time out and visit this temple for a great experience. Bhajans are the best because the feeling is quite unexplanatory in a good way.
Visit with family for a really blessed experience and feel great while walking out of this place.",1
"If u want a traditional visit to a temple with the priest performing an arathi and then giving u the prasadam, then this is not the temple for u!!
ISKCON is more of a centre for education and training in KRSNA consciousness. It's beautiful architecture, paintings and idols are a treat for the eyes. The 'prasad' here varies from laddoos to pizzas and burgers!!
There is a large collection of books on matters philosophical and theological.
The priests here are all highly educated (graduates of IIT and IIM!) former members of the fast paced, 'happening' society, who have abandoned that life in search of purpose and meaning.
There are a variety of courses one can join and can also stay at the premises of the temple and join in their daily routine and be exposed to the lifestyle and habits of the monks and priests who love and work there.
A visit to ISKCON is highly recommended on your to Bangalore.",1
Hari Krishna. What a nice temple. It is absolutely a must do. Be proper dressed or they dress you - long pants and shoulders covered.,1
"Went today with my friend, system arranged was very disturbing, unnecessary big lines because of system. They need to look for that.",1
Found this place is really holly place. Being Christian I have really liked it. Located near Rajajinagar and it was my first visit,1
Its basicalky radhakrishnz temple . Nice and big temple on top of a small hill. Huge csmpus . Theg have big parking facility. They serve bhog . They have a inhouse bookstall as well.,1
"Fantastic spiritual journey, always nice visiting the Hare Krishna temples. Always worth the visit to these temples!",1
Absolutely need to visit this magnificent temple. A big touristy for sure but incontournable. They have a big international bookstore plus a very extensive sale of sweets,1

The temple is constructed in a hill and the landscaping is done in such a way that you visit a row of shrines in every upper stage to reach the Radha Krishna shrine. The moment you enter the Chamber of Radha and Krishna, you will forget all your worries and immerse in the divinity. Its not only a temple, but a Shopping centre. You can get everything from bags to Krishna merchandise to cakes to whatever you name to eat here. Never ever miss this place when you are Bangalore. Go Enjoy have fun shop eat and be blessed.",0
The temple doesn't seem religious or sacred at all but rather just a place to sell you things. They make you go through shops and restaurants just to leave the temple. Paid admission does give you free sweets and a book though. Be sure to cover your shoulders and legs! Otherwise you'll have to pay for a dirty longi to cover you. You also have to pay to store your shoes and the entry...,1
"A very beautiful Temple. The Gold Idols are a real treat, as is the architecture. Lots of steps to climb, but there is an elevator for the aged and needy",1

"Visited this temple a few months back. The temple is located very near to the Metro line and also accessible by Road/Public Transport.
I liked the way everything is laid out.
Proper line and a place to Keep Shoes and then the baggage.
After doing this, you get into a queue into the first temple.
I think there were 2 small temples and then the main hall.
You need to climb a lot of stairs to reach the main hall.
Photography is not Prohibited.
The main hall is massive and I guess i saw Lift facility also available for those in need.

After taking dharshan in the main hall, we proceeded to the Lower halls where we found some Items for sale.
There was a hall for food stalls also.

Over all, you need 1-2 hours to see the entire place.

Parking is Available at Cost.
Washrooms available

One Visit was good for me.",1
"The temple is very famous by the movement spread nationally and internationally. The architecture and serenity of main temple is marvellous.

Arrangements for visitors is impressive, though you will be bogged by the number of religious salesmen trying to sell you one thing or the other in the mall like shops spread everywhere. And yes, they are overpriced to the brim.

I started to suspect that indian people might be very miserly to be reminded everywhere to find money and drop in some blind hundi, or some transparent box with a display of ego. Or are they just the opposite!

Enjoy the place with great views and nice architecture. The peace and stuti chants are the attractions.",1

"Fantastic marvellous place ,situated in heart of Bengluru.Very good reception from the people and very neat and clean place. The ambience is great.",1
The temple is beautiful. It has a very peaceful and harmonious vibe. Satwik food at the higher taste is something to look forward to. This place should be visited while at Bangalore.,1
"Reached here by metro with family. A short walk from there. The location is quite picturesque, located on a elevated hill. One has to walk inside the temple a bit though, which might be an issue for old people. Apart from this, you'll feel so peaceful up until one crosses the Lord Krishna's shrine in the main mandir. Post that there are a lot of stalls (books/food/decorative items etc..), which feels a bit out of place.",1
"Its very good temples with neat and clean. Big space to seat. Very calm and positive vibe place. You will also get prasad, and there are lots of eating place inside the temples",1
Believe this place can get very busy on the weekend. Go during week and have an easy time for 1-2 hours.,1
"Wow, what a moving spiritual place. One of the highlights of our trip to Bangalore! The ceremony and chanting, the vibe of pure devotion, the shrine - It doesn't matter what your religious beliefs, this is a beautiful and peaceful place",1
I enjoyed the visit to this temple and learned alot. Now I have a better appreciation for Hare Krishna...my memory is hearing and seeing them at the Los Angeles airport decades ago. Be prepared to take your shoes off.. you can wear socks unless you don't mind walking on the floor with everyone else's bare feet.,1
"Before I start detailed review I must say I am surprised & equally sad üòûüò° that lord Jagannath is not placed in this Iskon. We have visited many other Iskon in different cities this is different only here. However excellent place for a family time in this Hindu temple where you mind peace with Hare Krishna Hare Ram chant all around. Young old kids all dancing with the drum sound. We started around 4 pm on Sunday with decent traffic and had a good time spent in the evening. New car drivers to be little careful to take the car to the top as it very steep hill. You get lot to eat all varieties of snacks right inside the temple. Enjoy samosa, rasmalai, dhokla, donuts, variety of sweets. You get multiple spiritual books and accessories.. though it could be little expensive. Not sure why photography is prohibited in such a beautiful looking place. There after we went to Orion Mall which is right next to it. Open space in the mall is a nice place for some good time. We had dinner there and back home. Thanks for reading .. happy traveling üòä",1
iskcon temple is one of the most beautiful temple I have visited recently .Iskcon temple I have visited in Bangalore is one of the biggest temple in the world.i have visited this temple my self.it was full of lighting at night most beautiful temple,1
The maintenance is very good and prasadam is very tasty.You can buy lots of tasty sweets here and some devotional items too.Must visit for Lord krishna devotees.,1
"This was my first visit to ISKON Bengaluru. The place is huge and the architecture beautiful. Everything there has a southern touch!
You are not allowed to take camera/bag/shoes inside the premises. But they have good facility of keeping your stuff safe. They only charge Rs.2/- for that. You can take your phone but you're not allowed to take pictures inside the premises.
You can buy lots of goodies from the merchandise store on the exit path. They have books, accessories, food products which are really great.
The only bad thing were the washroom, very bad condition.",1
"The 4* I gave is all for the beauty of this place. Other then this I can't say any positive things. You cannot take a proper picture of the temple, unless you ask your driver to stop across the road which could be almost impossible. Inside the temple, there are few things you can picture. Of course you can and should admire the beauty inside.
A few advises: be prepared and have some trousers in your bag because you can't enter in shorts. If you have not, then they will provide a lungi which they help you to dress it. But be prepared to feel uncomfortable with it; it works like a circuit, once you proceed to the next point, you shouldn't come back.",1
Very nice and tidy temple. We visited in the afternoon. Had to wait in a long queue. But it's really beautiful.,1
I went with my friends visited Sri Krishna Temple they made inside amazing interiors I like the place .. thanks,0
"Bangalore is one of the main attractions such as ISKCON Temple, where many modern amenities and multi-vision cinema theater, computer assisted presentation, theater, and library etc.

It is a great place to visit. One of the Iconic place in bangalore. Also I hope this is the biggest or second biggest temple in the india. To reach here you have lot of transportation is available which includes metro as well.,1
"I honestly didn't like the place at all. It might be beautiful but it was not at all like a temple. They have converted the place into business and everywhere there was the statue of the person who had opened Iskcon. Overall I didn't like the place, as there was no peace.",1
Bangalore has many places for travelers to see and enjoy and one such place is ISKCON - Krishna Temple.,1
"Just a picnic spot..And.a restaurant..If you are looking for some device blessing, walk into your neighbouring temple",1
"Best place to visit, when you want some peace, want to think do swot analysis.

It was nice to see so many people involved with the religion there.

There was lots of places to buy small souvenirs, and a free meal was provided (although I didn't try it).

We went in late afternoon, so by the time we came out, it was night time and beautiful all lit up and with the water features as well.",1
Visited on recommendations from many people we met so went along - beautiful building and obviously a big commercial enterprise ! We had no idea what we were doing and seemed to be permanently separated from everyone else there !!! But went with the flow and hare krishnaaaed W when needed to . We felt that some explanations would have been helpful as felt we were part of something without any understanding of it - sometimes quite useful to just enjoy but this time would have liked to know and as for the ‚Äúparty bag ‚Äú on leaving we'll surely that money to provide that could be used elsewhere ? Have visited many other temples with better ambience but was an interesting experience .,1
It's a beautifully designed and well maintained Iskcon temple. The crowd is managed superbly. Great place for Krishna devotees.

This is the review only for house keeping Department.
Thanks.",1
"It's a nice temple ...no archeological Marvel, but huge temple for worship and peace . Unfortunately the atmosphere is completely spoilt by vendors selling all sorts of knick knacks , feng shui items , home decoration items with tag of religion , etc and too much space given to eateries. Just too many Commercial activities for a spiritual place .
For peace and spirituality I would rather visit any small temple nearby .",1

"A stunning hari Krishna temple just outside of the city of Bangalore.
As it gets hot and you have to take your shoes off to enter I would ensure you have cream for afterwards as the floor burnt my feet walking up to the temple. You can't take any photos inside the temple but can get a good view once you come out. You will receive a free offering of food on your way out. There are lots of gift shops and food stalls on the way out too which are reasonably priced. I would recommend it for a visit if you are in the area. The only thing I didn't like was the fact there were charges to get closer to the main part of the temple. The more you paid the closer you could get. We didn't pay and stayed in the queue and walked past.",1

However this is fully commercialized with krishna merchandise, 3D movie, lots of souvenir etc.The prasad (offering) that they serve is very tasty",1
"This an iconic building and I have been a visitor over the last 15 years, and have not been disappointed.

The temple atmosphere is electric, the spiritual aura magnificent and vibrations positive.

The breakfast, is very good indeed.

Simply brilliant!",1
"A divine experience. Its a big temple so needs some walking, but totally worth it. A must visit temple if you are in Banglore. Hare Krishna.",1
"Its a beautiful built temple.
Yes Crowded on occasion Days
Located very close to Metro Station.

Place for Meditation
Lots of books available....

Prasad full and Free Lunch in noon is served..

"too many people. the line takes very long to get to the shrine. Even there, people are not allowed to stand for more than a few minutes",1
"We visited here on our weekend and it was such A beautiful temple. We bought a package which enabled us to walk straight through rather than queue.

The temple is tranquil and it was lovely to learn about the culture.

I would definitely recommend a visit.",0
"It was interesting to read about the founder's background and the expansion of Hare Krishna from a small sect to the world movement it is today. The main hall was attractive, but still, less than 70 years old... also more items and areas focused on selling than ""for see."" Overall, not my cup of tea.",1
It is located very near to Metro station so very easy to reach. Sometimes it very much crowded with devotees. It has a place to sit and meditate in the huge hall. Books are available inside the temple. There is canteen inside it from which we can buy food.,1
"Good time to spend and very nice to get relaxed with a lot of peaceful views at this place. Very good to bring kids, adults, old people and all are Praying here without any differences. Lord Sri Krishna is always with you at every stage, placing the faith and trust will help you achieve your goals and objectives with confidence and expertise. People will be able to get meditated peacefully and the food available here is very hygiene and is very good for health too, Peace place for Family",1
"Inaugurated in 1997, it is one of the largest iskon temple in the world. We had visited on a weekday and the entire layout right from putting your shoes inside a bag to walking up the stairs for darshan to buying books accesories, food etc. The line is well managed. At the end of the line they offer free prasad to all devotees (optional).",1
"It was one of many visits, its a place that I visit on a regular basis. A must visit place at least once.",0
#NAME?,1
"It's maintained well.Good policy /rules, calmly anyone can visit, Good facility for out of station devotees as well as.
Very neat and clean temple.",1
"Evenings in ISKCON gets very messy. too many people. the line takes very long to get to the shrine. Even there, people are not allowed to stand for more than a few minutes.",1
I was totally depressed. So went to Simon temple for peace. But really I want to say you that I got peace inside of the temple. I just went insuse and say for whole and prayed for god to give peace. In the meantime I don't get but later I felt so fresh and relaxed. So really nice place.,1
When ever if you wanna have some peaceful time this is the place. Indulge in the calm and soothing chants of hare ram hare krishna.,1
"Crowd management is good and the place is very clean and well maintained. Also being on a hillock, the surrounding view is quite refreshing.
One has to walk quite a bit which may be difficult for the elderly.
Eating area had many veg choices along with onions, unlike a traditional temple.",1
It is the famous god Krishna temple in Karnataka. A parking facility is also available. We will get best devotional feeling here. This is the best place for vacation.,0
"I have went this temple with my friend enjoyed a lot,,very well maintained ,very peaceful.nice service they are providing eatables are also they are providing...",1
ISKCON Temple is visited by many devotees everyday. It is very well managed and a peaceful Darshan is assured in this Temple. Once inside the quarters one can hear rhythmic rhymes and charms which makes it so calming. If in Bangalore do make a plan to pay your respect to the Lord in this Temple.,1
Very neatly maintained temple with lots of divine energy. Lots of care put to instill positivity and high value Hare Rama Hare Krishna chant goes on in the evening with everyone joining in. This place has a book stall painting stall also,1
There are 2 Iskcon temples in Bangalore one in Rajajinagar and another in Kanakapura Road. Both are on the hill and is Grand with krishna and rukmani as the main God. After visit to temple one can have good prasadam also. Parking space is adequate. Must visit place.,1
Awesome experience. Pay to skip the line. well worth it. pictures are not allowed and you must remove your shoes.,1
"must when visiting the city, gives a calm and soothing touch to the spirit and soul ...one can sit for hours and meditate and stay connected",1
Best Hindu temple in Bangalore. Before entering you have to leave outside the shoes (to a so called wardrobe),1
"Go early this place gets really busy. You need to take your shoes off and leave them with an attendant but the system works well and cost nothing.
There is no entry fee but there are plenty of places to make donations so do this instead.
You will not be allowed to take a camera in and you cannot use your cell phone camera either.
They form an orderly line to get people through the inside of the temple so basically you get to walk around the shrine inside. It is huge and gold plated.
Once you leave the shrine area you walk through to where you can buy merchandise and book on Krishna and then there is a cafeteria where you can buy food.
There are toilets available once you leave the temple area.
Well worth a visit, we spent about 40 minutes here as there was no que, but I imagine when busy the wait to get in would be longer.",1
"The first time I entered this place, I felt I was entering some shopping mall with God at the centre. Honestly speaking, I didn't enjoy the place and the concept of ISCON temple just did not make sense to me.",1
"This is good place located on the West of Chord Road walkable from Metro station / Orion mall... like anyother ISCON temple this one is grand too...

while coming out from temple there are so many stalls where people sale books , papers and typical stuff related to God but looking at extreme commercialisation sometime it feels like purpose of temple getting defeated because their you get all kind of sweets , chats and even almost burger stuff",1
I went in the evening and the place was lit up and was looking amazing. There are stairs to reach the main temple but once inside you get enlightened with the light and the bhajans and is unexplainable the feeling of having God near you.,1
"What can one say about the temple. It amazing. Nice environment. Located in top. Memorising ""Hare Krishna, hare Krishna, "" on the foot for 108 times. Gives you more peace.

One has to visit.",1
"After they finished constructing the new premises, ISKCON has become one of the most popular places for tourists in the city. The atmosphere is very calm, management makes sure order is maintained. The temple is also very clean. It also has a few good places to eat. All in all, must visit this temple at least once.",0
"Really wonderful place, I had visited in middle of busy schedules, my mind got free and the paintings inside are amazing. The Prasadam they provided will blow ur taste buds the farthest. Really recommend this site for a unconditional soothing mind.",0
"Located on top of Hill on Chord Road, the ISKCON temple has beautiful idols of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna and mesmerizing floral decoration of the sanctum area. Many devotees and tourists visit the temple to get a darshan of the Hare Krishna Hare Rama.",1
ISKCON Temple is a landmark of Bengaluru for people from all walks of life with a spiritual bent of mind & wanting to understand the Indian Culture. It has a fine blend of religion with modern management & lot of learning about Krishna & the epics of India. A must see place in Bengaluru for all tourists from India & abroad.,1
ISKCON is not just a place of worship but is full of lessons. This is such a peaceful place and must visit for all those searching for inner peace. Definitely a get away from the hectic life. Best part about this place is the food! üôà,1
The temple is built on a hillock and is a typical ISKON temple. Early morning is best time to visit aa it is less crowded and you can witness the aarti,0
"ISKCON Temple Bangalore is very posh Krisha temple, very nice and decorated with color full lighting. we need more time visit. It is located at prime location.",0
"the temple is modern yet maintains the sanity of the place. I have visited almost all the time of the day.
the temple. prasadam and everything is very beautiful...
I would call it a place to visit",1
"It is a good place for worship of Lord Krishna, which is situated on rocks. It's one of the most cleaned and well kept temples in bangalore.",1
"Bangalore: you would experience that the city is all about running around; everyone seems to be mindlessly going about their business. In the middle of all this is the Hare Krishna Hill. ISKCON Temple is one place to visit to feed your Soul. It is serenity in the midst of chaos. The place is a marvel and a grand one at that, one cannot help but admire at the beauty of temple. It does not matter what your faith is, a visit to ISKCON is sure to be a very calming and enriching experience.
ISKCON also has a lot of ""purifying"" food for the body, right from the ""prasadam"" offered to each visitor. There are organic products and a very good Satvik restaurant to nourish body after a a filling experience for your inner self.",1
"They say vibration matters ...you feel something even before you are face to face with it .That is how I feel.when I get near to.tbis temple. All calm...rejuvenated...full of high energy and full of hope.its a heavenly place where art speaks to you in hushed tones...and the dieties seem to look at you so lovingly . For me it's very personal . I get the feel of what it would be like in an another realm. What being in heaven would seem like ...where the sound of bells ...the kirtans...the beat of instruments in the background would give you an insight into that cosmic realm.Such is the aura that greets me upon visiting this ISKCON temple in Bangalore.
The plus point I get to buy beautiful incense sticks on the way out... eat Prasad and feel invigorated and blessed .",1
"I went there all alone in bus. I had to change bus twice and hald to walk from the metro station. The temple staffs are very helpful. One has to submit the camera and footwear at the counter. You are not allowed to take the camera inside the temple. Thought they say photography is not allowed, i could see people taking photos from their mobile phone. They have different temples inside and the priest ask if you want special aarti. The architecture of the temple is great. One can go alone and never feel bored.",1
The temple is rested on top of a hillock with great architecture giving a serene feeling. The view outside is great.,1
"Though commercialized, this is a very beautiful temple. People are selling all sorts of items from food to photos. However, the idols of Krishna and Radha is very beautiful, and can easily spend a couple of hours in this temple.",1
Nice place to visit to connect to thou spiritual self but after the temple visit the exit is through the place which reminds you that may be thou ate visiting a mall or an exhibition,1
"I am visiting this temple from almost 15years. The temple hall is very good with traditional ceremonies held. Evening 8pm Aarti is very good to see.
But once we come out of the temple hall the commercial operation starts with a big restaurant which is busier than the temple. This makes the ppl having a feel that they are not in a temple.
Finally Prasad distributed is very hot and tasty.",1
"This is a great place to go - spiritually. The temple premises are wonderfully clean and quiet and you can have a good darshan with or without tickets.

There is a lot of vegetarian food options - from the really budget variety to the luxurious.",1
"temple built on a hill having great 3 Stepped architecture. View form top is good. Inside temple 3 main shrines are having gold plated domes but chants to Hare Rama hare Krishna gives peace of mind..!
On way out... you feel as if you are in food street.. having all sorts of food items from jalebi to Pizza available :).",1
"I have been to so many iskon temples and this is one of the best Hare Krishna Temple and there are so many activities going around, with a nice foodcourt where you can enjoy lot of savouries!!!",1
"ISKCON is a beautiful, modern temple. It is often busy, but worth it. As other reviewers have said, there is a restaurant and mini-mall type bazaar at the exit, but these things should not discourage a visit. Also, there is a decent selection of very reasonably priced books, available in many languages.",1
"Pleasant temple staffed by volunteers surrounded by a ‚Äú city ‚Äú of hundreds if not a few thousands flats in high rise buildings

Food in ‚Äú exclusive ‚Äú restaurant fair but not fantastic, and is expensive

Try the experience?",1
"Very nice temple and must visit place in Bangalore. Entry starts with chanting and queue moves pleasantly, devotional way. Apart from temple, it's huge commercial place",0
"Very big and well managed temple it will take 2 to 3 hours to visit and see this temple
Pooja is very nice I request people to don't miss arathi or pooja timings",1
"The place looks fabulous during night and bhajans are a must for a religious person ! try and take your family, if possible.",1
"I have been a fan of ISKCON temples all throughout and I keep visiting them wherever get a chance to. The one in Bangalore is decently built an yes clean as the other ones but I could not find anything too special about this place.

Just for some peaceful time, you can visit this place, just be in the decorum.

cheers...",0
"One of the most attracting and devine places in Bangalore, one must really give a visit. Situated about less than 1km from Mahalakshmi metro stop near to ORION Mall.. No transportation problem.. Nice prasadha too..",1
"This a beautiful temple in Bangalore (All Iskcon temples I have been to are beautiful). This is not an ancient temple and has none of those histories that many old temples do.

There is generally ample parking at reasonable price (I am member so I don't have to pay parking, but it's either Rs 30 per hour or Rs. 30 for the entire visit, not sure which one).
The campus is kept extremely clean and Hygienic (including public facilities). The darshan process goes through 2-3 small temples each a few steps higher than other so you slowly get to the main temple without having to climb too many steps at a time (good for elderly). The darshan is through a regular (free) line and a paid fast line (includes prasad and personalized puja). Lifetime members can go through fast lane complimentary. Fast lane also brings you a little closer to the idols compared to regular lane.

There are 2 restaurants on site + a small food court and all serve decent food (not great) for a reasonable price.

Note: Shorts are not allowed in temple premises so make sure to wear long pants.",1
"We had heard so much about the ISKCON temple in Bangalore and wanted to check it out. While the temple is clean and well maintained, we were very disappointed by the level of commercialization...... When you finish visiting the mandir, you are routed through what looks like a fair or mall with lots of items related to Indian and Hindu culture made from cheap plastics in China. It felt like you being forced to walk through a cheap version of a gift shop (10 times bigger than a normal gift shop) at the end of a museum visit. Sad....",1
At entrance you have chance to pray like Hindus . in the place you can see lots of traditions and praying ceremony.,1
Really beautiful temple and one of the biggest Iskcon temples I have visited. You can spend the whole day there. So beautiful.,1
ISKCON temple is one of the must visit religious tourist place in Bengaluru. It has got a positive vibe and also has a great food court.,1
"What a good place as a temple. Well built infrastructure with restrooms, restaurants, guest rooms. The god is fabulous",1
A very big temple but is very well managed very beautiful and the views are just amazing ought to go here,1
"Enjoyed my visit here - modern Hindu temple with a cheap cafeteria at the end- tasty local Indian food.
Very interesting interior to the temple. I enjoyed the visit",0
"Visited the temple with a friend of mine it was the only place we had actually planned as there no plane of any sorts for the rest of the day. The sheer hugeness of the temple right in middle of city amazed me and the people there are so well mannered and really good in communication even if u don't know the local language they are pretty good with English.

Overall a really good way to start your day or a place to run to if you want to just relax and get your mind free from all the hustle and bustle of the city.

One more important thing you can't hear any car honks or sounds once your inside the temple.",1
"You can explore this place as hangout place, to buy some puja related/spiritual stuffs or with a pure devotional mindset. whatever is your objective, this place has all of it. If you want to go as a devotee, then i would recommend, be there during the Arti (morning or evening). I love that time, you can be a part of the arti and start Chanting and dancing. For some time at least you will be in a different world. The entry to the temple is pretty long. If you leave your foot wears in the car itself, it might be better, else you need to walk long just to keep your chappals/shoes. The exit from the temple is through a shopping place and eating place (you cant avoid that). And interestingly you will find more people in this area especially at the food place. They will give you free prasadam while exiting, If you prefer not to take your car metro could also be a good option. Get down at Mahalxmi or Sandal Soap Factory station and then you can walk. They have a canteen with all sort of veg food choice (north/south Indian). The interior of the main temple is marvelous. In the evening, temple looks beautiful with lighting.",1
Highly recommend visiting ISKCON. Leave yourself 45minutes atleast to take it in and enjoy its beauty.,1
"I visited Saturday evening on non-festival day so avoided the long queue. Temple campus is huge though main temple isn't so big. Deities are also okay though ambience isn't serene. If you add whole experience of walking around, listening to bhajan (only one they sing, you know that), and attending Aarti then it's worth the visit. They have few eateries and a cheap canteen too for quick bite.",1
"I really enjoyed an hour walking and admiring the wonder inside. It is definite visit if in Bangalore. However, the crowd over weekends can get a bit daunting. Ensure to not wear expensive shoes or foot wear. As you have to leave it outside for a fee..can be collected later.
Respect the prayers and ensure to keep your mobile on silent.",1
"That was an amazing visiting. Was my first templo, so my experience was fantastic! Don' miss it, but go on a comfort shoes, cause you have to take it out.",1
"I visited this Premises on 7th Jan evening around 5 pm.

1. To start with this review, there are 2 categories of people who visit this Premises.

One with devotion looking for Peace and getting a feel of God - To those category this is not the place.

For the category of people who would like to spend some time , like on a picnic with family, taking selfies, eating food/snacks -Yes this is the place. I felt Eight out of Ten People visiting here belong to this category.

2. I do not understand why devotees are first asked to climb quite a long distance to deposit mere slippers and the queue management all the way to the main Sanctum Sanctorum is decided to create a serpentine queue in mind deliberately rather than otherwise since we can see the side gates deliberately closed.

3. Inside the main temple in Sanctum Sanctorum, the deities are beautiful and decorated well as is always with ISKCON Temples around India . There starts and ends the feel of the Lord and that is his boundary.

However further to that from the Sanctum, there are markets of Books,sweet stalls, restaurants,chaat shops,Tea/Coffee Shops forcing people walking out to get clogged in unnessary blocks and queues.I dont understand how Ice Creams, Samosa's,Bread, Pastry and Chaat items are termed Prasadam's in the coupons and sold inside temple premises.

4. If the intention is to run in a restaurant manner, need to run the same in appropriate professional fitting manner with tables,chairs and people to serve rather than club it within the temple premise and pollute the devotion.

5. On the exit passage , there was a ISKCON staff issuing small Photos to people in the queue and when my daughter aged 5 years streched her hand to get a small photo the staff in a ill-mannered tone said 'GO GO - THESE ARE NOT FOR CHILDREN'. Certainly if these are not for children it should be told in a tone which is acceptable and not in this manner. Felt like returning the small ISKCON Krishna photo to him back which he gave to me before my daughter streched my hand but felt there would be no difference between him and me if I return it back to him. My daughter suprisingly kept the Krishna photo all throughout the journey back home and refused to give it back to anyone else.

The Management should realise that Marketing/Commercialization should not hold upper hand over devotion.Temples are the places where the Lord Resides and these should be run for Lord Krishna and should not be created and maintained with the contention and mindset to generate income for Maintenance ,water , electricity ,house keeping staff and security people.

I am sure that this review would never even bother the management as a feedback for them as I do see a many of this nature in this forum but this review is intended for the category of people who intend to visit this 'Premises'.

I would never return to visit this ISKCON Temple anymore.",1
It is a big establishment and well maintained. Prefer visiting on weekdays for less crowd and more peaceful experience. There is a decent food court inside the temple area. You can also carry your own food and eat here (if you wish).,1
"Hare Krishna! A place to visit and highly recommended. Usually, the Sundays are crowded. Other near by attraction is the Orion Mall.",0
"Iskcon in Bangalore is really beautiful and being a large temple there one can expect a at least 30 mins to see the Krishna idol at the main sanctum sanctorum where there are 3 main idols.

What i did not like about the temple is the way they are try to sell the their products.. right next to the main temple they are selling gita copies, then once you go down again you pass through multiple places to buy things and the price for food is also higher... a samosa inside the temple costs 30 INR....",1
This is a bigger Iskcon Temple than in many other places. After darshan you can have good quality food at affordable rates.,1
"Being from Delhi, I have seen Iskcon Temple of Delhi & Mathura also. So my view of Iskcon Bangalore is based on the comparison with these two.

Iskcon temple Bangalore was very much overcrowded on sunday when we went there, cleanliness was also not upto the mark and finishing work was not that good as compared to delhi.

After you pass through the area where people worship Lord Krishna you enter in a big passage of market when you will so many stalls selling verity of things related to Krishna, so many food stalls are also there.

You end up wondering weather I am in a temple to get some peace or I am visiting any market. Sincerely I was very much disappointed with Cleanliness and Market type setup since till I visited Isckon Bangalore I had always associated Iskcon as temple where you will fall in love with Lord Krishna.",1
"It is a beautiful place but lacks the feeling of spirituality that a temple should have.
You can really enjoy beautiful architecture and mesmerizing idols of Lord Krishna.",1
Good place for darshan of Lord Krishna and as we walk thru the temple premises it reminds us the divine history of India. Peaceful place to spend,1
Beautiful Temple. Must Visit. You would like to avoid public Holiday if you want to avoid Crowd. Nice Food.,1
"Very clean and neat..one of the best temple for worshippers of God Krishna in Bangalore ample parking place...great ambience, good collection of books on God Krishna..ISKCON doing a great job in providing mid day meal to Govt school children..",1
"Beautiful temple in Bangalore with good artitac. Nothing more to say , I will say only todos every where........",0
This is the biggest iskcon temple after the Mayapur that i have visited. Nice temple though quite commercial,0
A very nice temple. Good lighting at night. Ambience is great. Clean and well maintained. Woth visiting,1
"The ISKCON temple is a must visit religious and tourist destination in Bangalore. The temple is excellently Maintained and extremely neat and clean. The inside of the sanctum is serene, with the soothing chants of Lord Krishna. Outside of the temple sanctum presents commercial aspect with lots of stalls selling food and other products. Visiting during early hours is recommended to avoid the rush.",1
"We have visited Isckon several times and it is always a great experience. The temple itself is beautiful and being on height it offers great view of surrounding city area and sunset in evening.

There is also free lunch served on Sunday. But since this place being very popular it is always crowded, my guess would be morning a good time for quiet experience. Definitely avoid evenings on weekends.",1
"Great experience, peaceful, wonderful location. The temple is serene, clean. Makes you want to visit it again",1
"It's such a beautiful sight to behold as you enter the temple :) Also you'll need quite a few hours to explore the temple properly.
What I didn't appreciate however was the blatant commercialization of the complex interested in ensuring product sales",0
Not like other tourist places. Do visit their evening rituals as the holy chant will amaze you with serenity. Crowded on weekend.,1
neat and clean temple with great ambient and environment. i visited with my friend and had great time,1
Visited this place with my family and friends. The day we went the place was very busy due to holiday season but it was a nice experience. Must visit spot in bengaluru.,1
Nice place to visit with family and friends . Many things to see and can spend time. Want to have great time,1
"Been here a couple of times. It is well organized in terms of the queue system. You will not experience any pushing or pulling while waiting in the queue. Have heard that the evening aarti is beautiful. There are many food counters behind the temple and there are a couple of vegetarian restaurants as well, a few handicrafts store, religious book stalls etc. Honestly, I did not find anything special about the temple. It is a good place to take your parents and relatives who would like to visit a temple in Bangalore",1
Nice and peaceful environment....Well maintained temple...Spend about a hour plus and its worth visiting it...Too good peace and calm....Over weekend it may be rush so plan accordingly....Little far from main city....But a must to visit if you in Bangalore...Then for sure you should explore...It's part of local site seeing tours as well..Otherwise you can hire a cab or auto very easily to visit this place if you are a tourist...,1
"This is a nice Krishna temple and is well organized. It is very clean as well. The inside of the temple is extremely well done, especially the murals. The paintings on the roof are gorgeous. I did not try the food in the temple. The 108 Hare Krishna chants were very nice. Recommend everyone to do that. The bazaar set up post temple was overdone though. It is fine to have 4-5 shops selling relevant merchandise. But to have an entire market set up seemed way over the top. Overall, good visit and experience.",1
Situated on quite a height. Tiring to climb so many stairs . More emphasis is on commercial sale which occupies nearly 60% of the temple area.,1
"This one of the Well maintained temple of Bangalore, this place pulls good amount of crowd in weekends. Temple has good attractive book stalls, restaurants, a small movie hall. There will be frequent speeches happening in this premises. The prasad that's given after darshan would be amazingly tasteful. The management also taking care of social welfare programs, if you need to be part of that, the volunteers would guide you there. If you want to have a peaceful Darshan and enjoy the beauty of this place, visit at your earliest possible, you could avoid rush.",1
"Located on a mountain. One of the finest and cleanest Temple in Bengaluru. It attracts crowd from all over the world. It has an amazing architecture and great views. It has ample parking place, hotels, marriage halls. They also prepare food under Akshayapathra scheme to feed the underprivileged school children...",1
my sister had come and we went there with family..it is a nice temple but was very crowded since holiday. had to walk.a lot but inner sanctum was great. after darshan it was bit commercial with lots of food stall . overall nice visit but not recommended on public holidays,1
"ISKCON is a prominent Icon in this IT Capital's Desktop. The peaceful serene atmosphere inside the temple shifts your mood completely. I closed my eyes and sta for a while. Was simply listening to the chantings there and had a divine experience.A must visit if you are coming to Bangalore.

They have very good murals painted at the main temple depiciting - Leelas of Krishna. There is a dedicated shop selling paintings and other art works. This place delights you if you are an art lover.

This temple is well connected to most parts of Bangalore with Metro train. From anywhere you can reach to Majestic Metro station and then change to Green lines and get down @ Mahalakshmi station, from which the temple is a five minutes walk / Rs. 50 in Uber.",1
"The Temple is located in Rajaji nagar. A very quite place, always try to visit in morning as there will be less rush.",1
I was impressed with the level of organization at this temple given that there are literally tens of thousands of people who come here daily. The systemised queuing with shoe and baggage storage made it very easy to flow through in and out.,1
"I wish to visit this place quite often, as my wishes fulfill on visiting this place. The food and prasadam is also tasty.",1
"A perfect devotional place and located in one of the best place of the city, people should visit and relax",1
"A landmark in Bangalore and must visit for events like Vikunta ekadasi. Traffic is a problem but there is parking available. Bit commercialized with it wedding halls, food stalls and merchandise.",1
"The temple is maintaining its charm after many years and even when the surroundings have become concrete jungle. Kids like this place for the structure and chanting of hare Krishna mantra , paintings and gold plated inner sanctum , food stalls after darsanam, and hot anna prasadam !! Would suggest to go for evening harathi..that's a very nice experience!",0
"ISKCON temple is such a beautiful temple in Bangalore, very neat and clean, lovely temple. Visited over there with my wife.",1
"Iskcon temple is located in Malleswaram. It's a very relaxing place. We always found paying for a Seva to be much better than getting in the general queue. This allows Darsan from close quarters without facing huge crowd. The kids really like books and CDs available from their shops (located on the way out). There is a car park close to temple, but the entrance is hidden.",1
"The temple is amazingly beautiful. The gold touch on the statues is worth adds to the grandness of this place. You walk through all these walkways up to the main temple. There are many rows of devotees From India and the world. As it is a holy traditional place, it's advised that you wear modest clothing. They don't appreciate too revealing outfits. We attended the Pooja. I really loved that there is Balram Statue In this temple. Balram is lord Krishna's older brother. You can buy spiritual items, malas,books, scarfs. At the end of the course of temple, you are offered Prasadam, khichdi and ladders. I was delighted to see a life size statue of Swami Prabhupad ji in seated in a Guru seat in a big hall. He appears to be very much present as living holy being. My gratitude to Swami Ji for having the foresight to allow devotees to have Darshan of Krishna. We had a special lunch buffet at their restaurant. It's very clean, modern, with delicious sattwic food. You should plan your meal there when you visit the Iskon Temple.",1
"Excellent place for anyone from any religion to appreciate hinduism. If you are devout Hindu you can freely and peacefully worship and get immersed with spirituality. If not you can enjoy being Hindu with absolute freedom of religion and belief. If you are non hindu and curious then enjoy and learn about this great religion. Well decorated temple of Krishna (main deity), Rama, Narasimha etc.. Loads of spiritual books in all languages. Pray and dance and sing feel free. Experience the divinity. Also umpteen choice of vegetarian satvik food. Endless things to enjoy.",1
"As a South American, I am not used to see in a temple the
concentration, and physical devotion that one perceives in the temple.
It is very moving.",0
ISKCON Temple Bangalore is one of the cleanest ISKCON temple of India. You can spend peaceful hours at this place,1
"We travelled along with a group of senior citizens.
The management was very cooperative and ensured that maximum distance covered by the vehicle to avoid walking.",1
"This is a cult temple in North West Bangalore. Has a display of how many meals have been donated, has multiple courses running for happiness, peace etc. Has a dress code to enter and separate lines for premium and non-premium followers. Isckon devotees have a special way of dance and they hard sell temple books. Found the showmanship very distracting to actually achieve peace and calm in this temple.",1
Nice n peacefull place to visit. One the must to see when you are in Bangalore. The spirituality is in the air of this place.,1
"Visited this temple with my family on Dec'17. The place is easy to find and we reached there in a cab. Need to walk a few distance before reaching the main temple. The place is neat and clean. It has a covered pathway so we always walk in shade throughout the temple. They have a souvenir shop just after visiting the main prayer hall. They have lot many varieties to choose from but i would suggest to skip this and go towards the exit where you get these for lesser price. It ranges from children's story books, color books, magnets,key-chains,photo frames and so on. Similarly they have an in house food court with limited varieties of dishes but that should be good for a quick bite ranging from Puliodharai, lemon rice, curd vada, chilli baji,dokhla, badam milk, julabjamoon at a reasonable price. Also they have a restaurant near the exit I did not get a chance to taste there. Overall we had a good time at ISKCON as it was not crowded and will visit again if I visit Bangalore again.",1
"Excellently maintained temple premises peaceful place for a nice weekend for
tense free time

Not merely a pretty building to look at and admire, to a Hindu the temple is the center of intellectual, artistic, spirituals, educational, and social elements of daily life.

The architecture attempts to dissolve the boundaries between human beings and the divine, seeking to stress the unification with the divine as the ultimate aim.",1
"I believe in Lord Krishna, that's the main reason me along with my family visited Iskcon. It s the best place that I know in Bangalore. Ur mind soul will relax with all the pains that u hv in heart. We really had a good time by visiting to the temple.",1
"The temple is very beautiful and captures the 10 Avatars in lovely images and dedicated mini-temples. Its kept clean and very orderly.
Worth a visit.",1
Just leave all your worries and stress on the shoe rack of ISKON temple and enter into the world of spiritual peace. Don't forget to participate in evening AARTI.,1
Its quite easily accessible from all the places in the city. there are several programs conducted regulary where you get to learn about culture and religion and life.,1
"I got introduced through FOLK program, it was a wonderful experience nice lecture, accomodation, Prasad, Aarthi etc. But after 3 years of being a part of their community realized that they have deviated from the original Vedic philosophy of following the Guru-Shishya Parampara. They have their own speculations and arguments.
So except of their philosophy everything else is good, nice tourist place, can take your guests, family members for different temple experience.",1
"Devine visit to a holy place. We are fond of iscon temples, not a dedicated follower though. Its a nice place to visit at Bangalore. Bit congested though. I found chennai iscon temple little better than this place. Too commercialised. People are forced to visit their shops for purchasing food, book.",1
"visit the place any day around 4 or 5 o clock ,no need to book any tickets.therer is hardly any Q.
In case u want to do puja buy the stuff and give it pujari.

Don't miss to try the food court its awesome.

After darshan u can sit in front of mandir and relax for hours",1
Nice n peacefull place to visit. One the must to see when you are in Bangalore. The spirituality is in the air of this place.,1
"Visited this temple with my family on Dec'17. The place is easy to find and we reached there in a cab. Need to walk a few distance before reaching the main temple. The place is neat and clean. It has a covered pathway so we always walk in shade throughout the temple. They have a souvenir shop just after visiting the main prayer hall.

Worth the visit while @ Bangalore. Metro connectivity is closeby so helps get over the nightmare of traffic in the city.,1
It was great experience with the temple at a height and going through process to enter this temple. Overall it was calm and quite and feel good factor within the premises. Good place to visit if you are one of those who are from north India and looking for a temple as a close match to your expectations.,1
If you are a Krishna devotee this temple is a must visit. This place is nice and calm and pretty big. Deities in this temple are also unique compared to other temples.,1
"There were a long cue to get in. The temple was nice. All the commerce on the way out - well...
The thing you should not miss (according to me) is the restaurant ""Higher Taste"". You don't have to go into the temple to enjoy the restaurant.
Remember not to wear shorts or you will have to hire a lungisheet from them (30rs+500rs dep).",0
"Good to visit once if you are in Bangalore for longer duration. Very nice ambience and filled with visitors during weekend/s. All can visit, Couples, Family with young n teen and with friends too.",1
this temple is very excellent condition with good place to visiting place Also and many visitors to visit this place and big temple also,1
Most peacfukk and satisfying atmosphere and wonderfull kirtans and bhajans. Must place to visit if you are in Bengaluru,1
"We spent three nights at ISKCON temple guest house and it was great visiting the temple for the evening aarthi. We were treated to simple breakfast, lunch and dinner that just served our purpose. No wastage of time in choosing food and catered to our need perfectly.",1
"A calm and peaceful place to spend time. The place gives good vibes thanks to Hare Krishna music. Good place to visit in groups or with family. Elderly may find it hard due to steps to climb. Also try out the attached restaurant, it has exquisite food.",1
"It is so beautifully constructed temple with serenity and calmness everywhere. Proper arrangements to keep your shoes. Visit in the evening is recommended. They provide Pongal as prasadam, which is so tasty. When you come back, there are enough shops and eateries by ISCKON.",1
"Very nice temple...awesome..clean temple
Temple opes at 4.15 pm...lot of que is there.. must visit once...try steam corn inside templr",1
"There are many reviews of this temple and i wont get into how beautiful the temple is.

My only problem is with the commercialization of the temple. There are many good things which the ISKCON foundation does. I have no doubt about that. But collecting money to get a special darshan? I found this funny. There are too many shops below the temple floor and I did not like how the temple feel was lost due to many shops being there. I would like to visit a temple for the feel of a temple and not because i would like to eat something.

The temple though is beautiful and the decoration, the ambiance inside the temple if lovely though.",1
"We ate Break Fast, Lunch, Tiffin, Dinner for 2 days during a marriage ceremony and reception hosted in the premises.
The sincerity of the services, and genuine taste are unimaginably true.
Seeing and tasting is believing.
Being a strong non-vegetarian I could not understand how I managed to forget non-veg and remained completely satisfied with only vegetarian food.",1
Iskcon sri radha krishna temple is inaugrated in the year of 1997. Very generous people with no pleasure. People can easily spend around 30 to 60 minutes here..,1
"A lot of restaurants and very good transportation options around the hotel. The staff consisting of Imad, Arvind and manager Sumoy went out of their way to make our 16 day stay a pleasant one. Thanks to them for their professionalism and all the help.",1
Really interesting temple where you easily spend 30-60 minutes and experience a whole range of different activities. Very generous people with no pressure.,0
"I visited the temple early morning and ethereal experience , you need to do it to understand and enjoy.
Don't miss this",1
"If you visit this place during morning hours it will give you a peaceful experience.
Very huge temple elegant ally decorated
The main attraction is the main hall.",1
The iscon is a iconic temple in Bengaluru it's connected to all major part of cities through metro ..good.,1
"I felt It is just another temple but commercialized. Stalls are not priced much. Iskcon temples are beautiful wherever they are. A big number of stairs to climb. Heard that wheel chair lifts are available and I could see cars going upstairs directly. There are special darshan tickets, but not sure what is the use when all people can break into the special darshan queue. At the end of exit there is a restaurant and big stall which have all variety of food items.",1

"This is beautiful temple located in the heart of the city; Very clean and well organised; It is well managed and methodical. mainly hindus visit the temple, but we noticed tourists from other countries too.",1
"Everything else than Hinduism; you need to walk for 30 minutes - especially when trying to get out - to go through an extreme amount of places selling ""relics"", books, DVD's, CD's, food etc etc. The temple itself is ""ok"" but there are many more beautiful smaller temples around in Bangalore, but this is nothing but a greedy money machine. Scam when worst and nothing to do with Hinduism (""Virtue entails following societal roles and performing selfless acts, but immoral acts are ones of greed and hatred."")",1
Best place to visit for some peace mind and fresh air with gods blessings and the view of temple is very good,1
"What a shame they won't allow you to take photos inside the temple. The interior is amazing. So much gold! This must be a very wealthy organisation, for they are building an even bigger temple on the outskirts of Bangalore. There are lots of things to spend your money on, as you leave, but sadly no images of the interior of the temple.",1
Mind fresh and blessed and very gud place for old age guys and enjoy able place to .i usually visit it,1
Very nice temple and not to be missed. Visited at the time of arthi and not much crowded during week days. Very well maintained and clean. Good food served as annadhanam and not to be missed. Also sell variety of food and quite cheap price. Overall good experience.,1
"Recently visited Iskcon Bengaluru, overall very nice experience. Just like any other Iskcon, it is peaceful and well maintained.",0
One of the best temples I have visited ever and a must visit spot to anyone who visits to Bangalore. Like the way the outside areas are designed to control the flow of crowd,1
"Friday morning 17th November and we visited this sacred Temple which stands majestically among the tower blocks and new skyscrapers of Bangalore.

Sorry there are no photographs to show the grandeur and magnificence of the Temple, photography is not permitted, so only photos of the grand entrance.

Once through security checks we proceeded to the ticket office where there was a variety of ticket prices, which was determined by what parts of the Temple visited. Our ticket was 300 Rupees, the option with the least access but was for up to 6 people.

There is a strict dress code here, it is not permitted to wear shorts, however we were able to hire a Dhoti, a length of fabric tied around the waist and coved the legs. We each had to pay a 500 Rupees deposit and 20 RS laundry costs.

We also had to remove our shoes and leave them in the storage area there was a charge of 2 RS for each pair of shoes, which we collected when exiting the Temple.

We followed the signs and started climbing up the steps, we soon arrived and the first small Temple and Shrine. We continued upwards to the next slightly larger and a bit grander and ornate Temple. The third Temple at the top of the stairway was incredible, it was so ornate and colourful, stunning, unable to adequately describe this holy place. We mingled with other visitors and worshippers 

Before standing in front of the main shrine, our hands were washed by a Monk, then laid on sacred flowers and were blessed these were presented later before the Grand Master. After our visit to the Shrine we were presented with a bag of Prasadam food, this is food that is eaten after prayer. 

We were also presented with a gift of a book and literature about Hare Krishna.

The exit route took us through a large area that was dedicated to the sale of religious items and souvenirs.",1
Must visit place for people of all background to make you understand the diversity of this nation...,1

Main shrine is of Radha-Krishna.
Krishna Balrama.
Nitai Gauranga (Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda).
Srinivasa Govinda ( also known as Venkateswara ).
Prahlada Narasimha.
Srila Prabhupada.[5]",1
"This temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna. Modern architecture style with glass facde and has in-house snacks, sweets outlet. Nice flower decoration of God's idol and the Morning aarti (prayers) are really worth a visit.",1
"Visited the Hare Krishna temple during my time in Bangalore. The chanting music throughout the temple was uplifting. When we got to the main temple, we were greeted by one of the priests who asked us our names and added us to his prayers. He then gave us a blessed flower, a bag of sweets and a book on yoga.
En route out you can get a rice dinner if you're hungry at no cost.
There's an abundance of gift shops and cake stalls on the way out too. ISKON was a very different temple experience which I really enjoyed.",1
The ISKCON temple in Bangalore is dedicated to Lord Krishna and is one of the largest in the world. The idols of Radha and Krishna as well as the floral decoration is outstanding. ISKCON manages many charitable activities including Akshaya Patra which feeds 1.3 million children across India.,1

"One of the biggest ISKCON temple I have visited so far. It's all divine feeling. Ample parking space is available. There are darshan tickets available which are actually SEWA tickets. For those SEWA tickets, you get some special darshan where you can spend some time to see God from close distance. Each ticket has some prasad which is given after darshan. There are many stalls for books, religious items, photos, and clothes. If you are hungry, there are multiple stalls for food items like, samosa, chat, dhokla, lemon rice, fried rice, gulab jamun, rasgulla, juices, and many more.

"We visited this temple during the Diwali vacations. ISKCON is truly a divine and spiritual place. This place gives one a peace of mind. After taking the darshana of deity, Prasad in the form of ""Khichadi"" is served to every devotee. If you don't wish to eat it using hands, then suggest to carry spoons with you. The mahaprasad (full fledged meal) is served in their dining area. Both Khichladi as well as Mahaprasad are really tasty. The buttermilk is served directly in the plate at the end of Mahaprasad. They don't serve it in the glass. So one may carry his/her own glass.
Overall a must visit place in Bengaluru.",1
Iskon Temple is a must visit place for Hindu followers of Lord Krishna - where one would be lost in devotion of God .,1

the big size laddus and the library too really good.

best among all is the time you can spend during the prayers and watching the krishna devotees sings and dance.
really a great feeling",1
"The temple infrastructure is breathtaking, calm, serene and you get awesome peace of mind. The temple is located very close to Orion mall and you can simply connect with your inner being or head out to the sweets corner serving unlimited varieties of food. You can also shop for some lovely frames, calendars, clothes and many other things available there. A must visit for all.",1
"From chanting the holy name to buying Krishna books to having Sattvic food, Its a good outing for young and old alike. Evening artis and courses help one get in a journey of self discovery",1
"ISKCON is the HQ of the Hindu religion in Bangalore. There are a few branches in the world. Visitors are welcome to visit but they expect foreigners to chant walking up the temple. It sounds ridiculous. They also have vegetarian restaurant, food, books they sell there. No shoes, camera allowed and it is better to leave your shoes in the car. Too many pickpockets or someone stealing your shoes. It is better to go during the weekday to avoid the crowd.",1
"Very well organised place. A treat to watch and go through the entire temple premises. The prasadam is very good. The food court or the restaurant inside serves delicious food. Great cafeteria. Books collection is great.
Lastly, the temple where deity resides is mesmerising. It offers a place to meditate",0
The temple had three stages of three different vishnu avatar. located near metro station for easy commuting to city. Night times the temple looks really fantastic. Avoid riding festival times as this will be more crowded.,1
its a beautiful and wonderful place to worship a god and we will get peace of mind .but all things are very costly to buy.,1

The main prayer hall with its tall domed ceiling and ice cool marble floor give the place a surreal feel even if the place is crowded with pilgrims.

The temple kitchen prepares a huge variety of vegetarian delicacies which are a treat to eat.

Amazing temple... a must visit if you are in Bengaluru",1
"Can get very crowded during holidays, especially during a religious holiday. There are a lot of steps to reach the top. Although you can take your car/cab almost to the top and can take a lift to the main temple. They also can provide wheel chair to people who are unable to walk.

Krishna bhakts would love this place. Krishna in all his roles look amazing. There is an area where you can sit in the main temple.",1

"This temple is not a run of mill kind of temple. Its a beautiful place, very different from our regular temples, peaceful and a good place to mediate to find your inner soul.",0
Its a beautiful and superb temple of lord Krishna. very peaceful. Heavy rush on weekends. huge campus. hygienic and well maintained food court. Should visit.,1
"Unlike most ISKON temples,this one is bigger. Plenty of space for spiritual aspects and also spiritual artefacts.Prasadam is almost a wholesome meal and wonderful to see whole lot of children being encouraged to eat here.",1
"Really a very divine and spiritual experience!! Temple is built beautifully, a wonderful place to worship Lord Krishna!! Reciting of bhajans makes the atmosphere very peaceful!! Must attend their evening Aarti!!
Gauranga!!
Hare Krishna!!",0
"Extremely lavish, huge, peaceful. This place is dedicated to Lord Krishna. The iskcon committee manages this temple and have commercialized the temple premises with food and souvenirs to buy.",1
"While ISKCON has a nice high vantage point from which to look over the city and some attractive features, it didn't strike me as a particularly spiritual place. It felt more like a mall. In part, that's because after you walk through the glitzy worship area you then move through countless places where the focus is on selling food, books, cheap plastic toys, and other merchandise. I struggled to understand how this was a place where people were taught and encouraged to let go of ego attachments or experience anything more divine than money being captured in multitudinous ways.",0
"Excellent place to spend some time with your family. Well located with good scenic beauty. The chant of ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" gives a soothing, peaceful feeling. Must visit.....",1
"extremely well maintained , beautiful architecture ..super prasadam , great view ..very serene and meaningful visit",1
"ISKCON is always a good place to find peace and connect to a higher power. This location in Bangalore is no exception. It is situated a little out of the main city of Bangalore but is well connected with the Kempagowda bus stop. The place has different levels and you need to walk through some stairs to reach the final mandap. There are convenient racks and staffs to coordinate for leaving your slippers before entering. Photography is not permitted. The food stall of the temple is amazing. After food for your soul you can treat your body too.
There is a big mall at walking distance from the temple. After the darshan, shopping is an option.",0
The only tourist place I got time to visit in Bangalore. Its a beautiful temple. Very well organised and maintained. Maybe a bit too commercialised. But a good experience nevertheless. But the beauty of the place makes up for it.,1

A must visit place and also only a 1 time visit for a regular non religious guy. a Great place for a Krishna worshiper.,1
"This vast Hare Krishna Temple was a complete eye opener for a novice like me.

I'm guessing I went during 'low season' judging by the impressive organisational infrastructure set up around it (taking shoes, taking bags) - to have gone when the place was packed would have been a very different experience.

After de-shoeing I followed the prescribed route upwards towards the temple and inadvertently found myself joining a snake of people chanting 108 Hare Krishnas. I say inadvertently, I think perhaps there was a way to get in without this, but I didn't see it, and I was glad to have done it - without question this was the most 'stick out like a sore thumb' I've ever been in my entire life.

The main temple is vast and peaceful, with live music playing. There was an unexpected book sale going on in the corner (I picked up the Hare Krishna Book of Vegetarian Cooking for 330 rupees - it looks promising) and some fairly helpful information boards about Srila Prabhupada, the founder of 108 Krishna temples worldwide.

Departing the temple takes way longer as you make your way past many, many stalls selling anything and everything Krishna-related.

The final step is being given a delicious bowl of lentils and rice 'Khichdi prasƒÅda'. The bowl was made of a dried leaf and the food just gorgeous.

I got there by the Metro (Mahalakshmi Station) - it's a 10 minute walk along a fairly busy road.",1
"Wonderful place to spend some spiritual time with your family. the chants of Hare Krishna will give you great peace of mind.
The place is well maintained and will be a very good place to visit with your family when you are visiting Bengaluru.",1
"We visited the temple on Saturday Morning around 10. I think it was the perfect time. It's our first visit. The temple is so clean. Well architectures. Calm and we'll Maintained atmosphere Given us a pleasent feeling. There are stalls inside for buying books, photos etc.. Nice place to visit. People with belief on lord Krishna will enjoy bit more. Worth to mention about the ""prasadam""... It's simply fantastic.",1
"It was interesting to follow the crowd to say the chants at each step before going to the main hall, yet the temple itself had lots of regulations, and if you want to walk closer to the Krishna statue, you need to pay extra. On your way to the exit, there are lots of shops, including food stalls, which make the place quite commercialized and like a market. Photo is strictly prohibited in the premise and the guard may ask you put cameras back in your car when they saw it.
It is an interesting experience, but it isn't a must if your schedule is packed.",0
"ISKON is a place where one experiences peace of mind. If you just sit in the temple, you will experience Shanti. Excellent atmosphere to meditate and chant Hare Rama Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Hare Rama.",1
"Attending morning pooja at 7am is a great experience. The decoration, the ambiance, the people chanting Hare Krishna mantra and the dance by the disciples all takes you to a different world.",1
Beautiful place for early morning prayers and late evening Aarti and ritual dances where monks and general public indulge in the celebration. Weekends are fairly busy so expect long queues and short darshan times. Good satvik restaurant attached to the temple,1
"This is a place for children with a lot to discover and holy place for elders.Children enjoyed the cake Prasadam there,of course eggless.",1
"The is a must visit place for Krishna devotees. Place is easy reachable by Metro, Buses or by car. There is ample space for parking inside the temple premises. Apart from being a devotional place, this can be a good weekend outing place. There is a restaurant inside which serves varieties of food. If you need to have a quick grab, again lots of snacks available. For kids there is Krishna movie being screened. Its a wholesome entertainment place apart from being a temple.",1
"this is one the best maintained systematic temples in india,never miss the evening aarthi it is really superb",1
"Very good temple built with modern architecture. Special mention about the dieties, they look very lively and are grandly decorated. If you are looking for a spiritual and peaceful visit do avoid weekends and holidays!",1
"This is not a place you can visit in a hurry - given Bangalore's infamous traffic , one needs to set aside half a day for this trip . And then there is the queue, the mandatory chanting and the beautiful aarathi to experience . The dieties are divinely decorated, prasadam is excellent and there are a plethora of book stalls and food kiosks .Within the temple complex, there is a good vegetarian restaurant called Higher Taste - well worth a visit if you have worked up an appetite - over 50 dishes served buffet style . Make sure you remember where you deposit your footwear - the signages are a bit confusing , we had to walk around a bit after the darshan to located the footwear kiosk !",0
I love ISKCON temples in general and this place lives up to its name. Amazing architecture and pleasant atmosphere. Must visit when you are in Bangalore.,1
"ISKCON Temple is situated on top of an hill, called Hare Krishna Hill. With its nicely sculptured GOPURAMs decorating its roof and main temple structure, the temple looks very much ornamental and gorgeous. Not only that, as I mentioned earlier since it is on hill top, the Temple Complex is visible from far away distance. In fact it has become a famous landmark in the vicinity of Chord Road, Mahalaxmi Layout, Rajajinagar and Yeshwanthpur, so to say for the whole of present day North Bangalore ISKCON Temple is an awesome landmark. The approach to the temple, parking facility are well taken care. One can visit the temple leisurely without much hassles. All types of public transportation are available to this place, viz: BMTC buses, Metro train. While traveling in METRO, one has to get down at Mahalaxmi station and the temple is at walk able distance. When you chart out a program to visit this place, please allot minimum half a day, if you are visiting from a nearby place,otherwise, it will become a full day program. Your are visiting this temple not only for devotion, there are are other attractions like amphitheater, shopping, vegetarian restaurants run by temple committee, here food is available at subsidized rates in good ambience, marriage halls are also there. It is a well managed LORD KRISHNA TEMPLE run by internationally acclaimed ISKCON. When you are in BENGALURU a must to visit place.",1
"Mysore Soap factory is the metro rail station to get off to visit this temple. You will still need to walk some one-third kilometer to visit the temple. Remember you will need to walk some hundred steps from the roadside to climb up the temple for darshan. It is better for you to drive up the hill and park for a fee and then walk into the temple,especially if you are elderly or sick. The temple offers food in two restaurants. One is much less expensive in the middle of the temple complex offered as PRASAD. The other is, of course, another vegetarian restaurant of 3 Star category located on top of the hill. Both are good places to eat!",1
"People who has minimum of 1 to 2 hours time has to visit this place, temple is good but after darshan, it is full commercial. You have to go through all the shops eventhough you dont like, there is no exit immediately after the darshan.",0
"This place is inside the city. You can visit for any longer and any time of the day.

Now, this place is connected by metro. So, no hassle of driving to this place at busy Bangalore traffic.

I was driving to this place earlier. Recently during my last trip with family (a month ago), I went by Metro. I live at Bannerghatta road. So, I wanted to try the metro. Went to Yelachenahalli‚Ä† stop and took metro.

You can get down at ""Mahalakshmi: stop. 10 minutes walk from this station.

A good part of the temple is ambience, spectacular look and beauty of Krishna. There are an amphitheatre and several attractions.You can have nice food. You have several options, as 30 to 40 varieties of food available.

So, plan for at least 3 to 5 hours with family.

Happy trip to Krishna Conciousness.",1
Not a place to worship only but an institution that inculcates service for the lord and the humble devotees,1
"Right place to worship god. Calm environment. Hygienic and highly tasteful prasadam.
very well managed temple.",1
"Must visit place for Lord Sri Krishna devotees in Bangalore. Superb architecture. Besides, Krishna temple, temple of Lord Venkateswara is also worth visiting and worshiping in the same complex. Very centrally located. Well connected with public transport including Metro service.. Very well maintained. No hassles. Krishna jayanty performed on large scale. Large crowd at that time visit the temple. Hare Krishna volunteers taking good care of the temple.Attahed with good restaurant. Their work of Akhayapatra feeding the school children is commendable an deserves support from every one for this noble social cause.",1
"The temple is right besides Orion Mall and can be reached easily by metro. The place is really beautiful with fountain and lighting at the night. The place generally gets quite crowded on the weekends. Once inside, one can find a lot of stalls selling things like prasad, souvenirs etc. which makes it sort of a flea market/shopping mall. This is the only thing I do not like about the place. One goes to the temple to be at peace and experience the quaint atmosphere but it was nowhere to be found at ISKCON temple.",1
Very nice place for family and friends for the best architectural design and devotional experience in this place,1
One of the best iskcon temple ever i visited in india. Spread in a large area. Beautifully structured . Nice location. Near to a shopping mall . And connected to other prime areas . If you are going to bangalore once you must visit to feel spirituality.,1
very beautiful architecture and peaceful place if not visiting on weekends or on festival days...must visit if in Bangalore.,1
Amazing place....The chant of Govinda Govinda lets you forget everything in the world. Get so much peace every time I visit this place,1
"If you really like aesthetically beautiful temples and different from what you are used to see over the years, or have the perceptions about Hindu temples, then this temple will change them. This is a modern, very different, very well designed & beautiful, clean and well organized (much better than the ancient temples). Barring the ISCKON's constant pursue of buying things, memberships of the society rest all are perfectly placed for a divine and holy place",1
"Beautiful architecture very busy
Try not to go weekends - use the website to determine times of worship. Helpful devotees will assist.",1
"Isckon temple is a temple built for devotion of Lord Krishna and has been built much recently compared to other conventional temples which were built centuries ago. It is a big temple with a very good maintenance and cleanliness. It is situated at a hill. So, people with knee problems and health issues may be prepared for it. It has a pond beside it which is a beautiful sight to watch. The chants of ""Hare Krishna"" brings peace to your mind. The temple is not that crowded as I expected it to be. The only thing I feel a bit off was that after darshan, they make you go through a plethora of shops which you may be uninterested in. I would expect a direct and short exit. Other than that, I would recommend that this is a must visit place in Bangalore irrespective of religion. Watch out for paintings on top of the wall inside temple.",1
It is the main Hindu temple in Honolulu. Pooja starts very early in the morning. It is a delight to watch. You will get a healthy and tasty vegetarian food as prasadam. I had breakfast. U can volunteer in kitchen to make food and/or join them for chanting and reading. There is a small library of Srila Prabhupada's collection of books. U can read or just walk around the temple. It is a divine experience. The priest of the temple called Sundar was very kind and I really appreciate his hospitality. Buses are available and there is ample parking space too.,1

"Respecting the Divine part and sharing the experience of being devotee only.
LOCATION: Its situated at one of the suburbs of Bangalore. Though now extremely well connected by means of METRO. Self driven may have challenges in getting parking inside during evenings of holidays.

TEMPLE: Like most ISKON, Circulation within the temple is absolutely controlled. There are many activities roped in before and after the ""Darshan of Divine"". Before the ""Darshan"" one is supposed to go through series of small shrines and serpentine ques as per the crowd. Based on one's frame of mind, one may think this as forced imposition or a preparation time to calm down before meeting the Divine. One can sit sometime in the big hall after darshan. The way out has many events like laddo and other sweet prasadm counter, intellectual discussions with one of the sadhus, audio visual show of about 10-15 minits, bazaar of ISKON merchandise (and this is well stocked), Elaborate (paid) food counters. At the end of exit trail, there is one casual (paid) dining area serving good veg food. Before the disbursement, however, all alike are given ""prashadam"" (mostly a khichadi kind of preparation). No one leaves ISKON empty stomach.

SPECIAL NOTE: Peace seekers shall look for non festival days. On working days and in morning hours the energy and peace in front of Divine is one experience of life. wear shoes which are easily removed and worn. Avoid carrying much and even bigger purses. Respect the security personnel as they are doing their important job. Keep the whole of half day.",1

"Built in 1997 this complex is a major landmark in Bengaluru. The architecture is contemporary ( glass for natural light etc...) . Since it is on a hill , one has to do quite a bit of climbing up and down. Special Darshan costs Rs.300 onwards. One passes through smaller temples before reaching the Radha Krishna temple on the summit. The main temple hall has a glorious tall ceiling. Diety idols are all in pristine white marble . After the Darshan you proceed through various stalls (books, artefacts,snacksetc..). A full fledged restaurant is inside the complex. The Vedic coffee is a must have here.",1
Iakon temples everywhere are having very nice interior and sculptures.. they have money and it's been seen there.. otherwise as spiritual point of veiw everyone has their own opinions.. in my opinion I couldn't find any mental peace there.. food served there as prasaad is good but the food available in cafeteria is of low quality.. we had very bad experience.

Then we went thru all the stalls in the temple and had prasadam.

We recommend everyone visiting Bangalore should visit this temple at least once.

Jagmohan Shetty",1

We had dinner in the veg restaurant within the temple premises, food is tasty though a bit expensive.",0
"Heavy crowd and lack of enough parking place for such a huge temple is actually a bane. When the crowd was huge while planning, the authorities both sanctioning as well as temple authorities failed to provide ample car parking for the temple and hap-hazard queues and parking in toads lead to traffic snarls near the temple should be avoided.",1
Nice place for Lord Krishna Lovers. Neat and clean palce and nicely located in the centre of bangalore in very small hill.beautiful temple from outside as well as inside and very organized queues to manage crowds.

Clear cut guidance on all aspects of visit.Hygienic and very tasty food and bakery items which is egg less",1
The International Society for Krishna Conciousness is a contemporary building which houses the temple complex. It's a phenomenal for Spiritualism and Religious activity. There is peace of mind. Besides praying. Check on the books that are for sale. Combine the visit to the temple by also visiting the Mahalakshmi Temple and the Anjaneya Temple complex about a kilometre away. It's surely worth the time spent.,1
"Queue, staircases to start with. Check lift option for sr citizens. If you have pure spiritual purpose, just take ""darshana"" of idols and exit.

It's a mini mall there to sell books, artifacts , clothes etc. Plus food counters with huge varieties....But best is to take Prasadam and exit. Go to some restaurant where you can sit peacefully and eat. Inside there is too much crowd to walk, eat, pay, order....

Idols and hall are the best part. Sit there for some time, watch the idols. Meditate if you can.

Little walk to Mahalaxmi metro station, you can also visit small Saibaba temple on same side of main road in Rajaji Nagar Ph1.",0
The perfect place to enjoy calm and peace. If one can listen to live kirtan as well nothing like it! The hot prasadam is something not to be missed.,1

I liked this way of chanting. Inside the temple also good. It is worth to visit this temple.",1
"Very beautiful temple from outside as well as inside and very organized queues to manage crowds. The idols were decorated most elegantly, in the usual ISKCON style. There were quite a few notices on encouraging donations of different types from the point where the queue starts till you reach inside the main temple; however, you can still go inside and pray even if you do not wish to donate. I bought a lot of useful books from the books counter though.",1
"I personally visited Iskcon Temple quite often during my stay in Bangalore for more than a decade. When I was a student, I used to frequently visit there. Even after I got into service, I'd go to Iskcon Temple whenever I'd have the time or I'd feel upset. This place has something to boost up. Whenever I'd be dull or upset, I'd visit and feel energized. The ambiance is mind-blowing. It'd definitely change your mood and your heart and mind will fill with positive energy. I recommend all tourists and travelers to visit this place once.

I visited this place last year October again when I went to Bangalore for some personal reasons. 9I don't stay in Bangalore anymore)",0
A beautiful temple and abode to the Lord and his wife. One of the best Iskcon temples in the country. Very clean and well maintained. Make sure to relish the sweets and snacks on your way out of the inner sanctum. Usually gets crowded on evenings during weekends though.,1

"I visited here with my family, its very nice and well maintained and high genic, only thing is they have opened a market inside temple which I didn't like , they are working for money.",1
It is the great place I have visited ever. The scluptur in this Temple is very nice and I felt very happy,1
"If you believe in God? Do you want to find peace and pray to lord Krishna, Then this is the place you must visit.
To plan a visit for ISCON temple you have to follow the timings as it opens at 7:15 AM to 1:00 PM and 4:15 to 8:15 PM.
Requires at least 1 hour, more if crowed is more.
It is very well managed and maintained. once reached at gate of the temple you have to go through security check and then you have to deposit your slippers and shoes. They charge you for the same a little as Rs 2 per pair. After depositing you can go up stairs to temple and the queue of devotee starts. As there will be continuous chanting of radhe krishna you will not feel the wait and queue you will get to first temple in no time. If you take the stairs and go little more further up you will find the main temple where Radha and Krishna statue are kept which all are made up of gold.
Pray and sit for some time in the temple passage which is huge, You can purchase sweets as prasad from there or books if you like. On exit you will get free prasad and one god picture card with mantra on it.
It's really a good place to visit.",1

"Place which is really well maintained with a lot of effort, it's more looks like a place of tourist visit and less spiritual feeling, on a weekend you can visit once to see the art inside the temple...",1
as we see these pics this temple is something special. It is actually the only ISKCON temple where they do proper worship. ISKCON Bangalore is doing substantial service by distributing 3 million midday meals for school children every day. They also distribute more books than any other ISKCON temple.,1
A very good temple which runs with motto on Krishna consciousness. One can feel the divine power by looking at beautifully decorated lord Krishna with loads of flowers words aren't enough to describe those moments N feelings... Soothing fragrance of incense sticks makes you feel like that you are at divine presence... Eateries are available and sacred Prasad is distributed to everyone.,0
It is very good and worth a visit in bangalore. We went there before janmashtami and could see the preparations in full swing.,1
"Visit if you must. Nothing great about this temple - neither in comparison to other ISKCON temples around the world, nor in comparison to other beautiful temples in or around Bangalore. This is not to say it's not nice - it's just not very remarkable in beauty, architecture or ambience.",1
This is one of my favorite temples in Bangalore. One get a calm and peaceful feeling once inside the temple. But the crowd can be overwhelming at times. The temple also has a wonderful canteen and store that sell Hare Krishna T-shirts.,1

No photography permitted.",1

One of the best Iskon in India. It's huge from inside and very fascinating.. the only thing is that we have to walk a lot. This place is peaceful with lots and lots of eating options available and the best part is that everything goes to charity. So really amazing place and religious point of view it's is so peaceful.. beautiful,1
"I visited ISKCON temple multiple times. Evening visits are nothing less than fest to your eyes.

Need to take steps to reach the temple. Older people needs to keep that in mind.",1

"Don't come to ISKCON Bangalore, if you're looking for spirituality and bhakti. This place has too much distractions, money-making and a maddening rush. I was taken aback by the level of commercialization being practiced by the ""prabhu""-s within the temple perimeters. Besides a magnificent architecture and beautiful Radha-Krishna idols and paintings, there is nothing here to inspire a sense of spirituality. It is located bang in the middle of a major commercial region of the city. At ISKCON temples, I feel a sense of peace, tranquility and divine solitude. However, I left from ISKCON Bangalore, disappointed.",0
".
Its one of the most traditional aaratis done here to lord krishna with chants of hare krishna all contribute to decor of the temple with flower pooja and dhoopa aarati there is total serenity in and around the temple.",0
"When you enter the temple, you are supposed to chant with every step....
N when hundred odd people do that together, the place gives you divine feeling even if you are not in that mentality initially.

But once are done with all this, you do realise how big business the trust has been running",1
"the visit to the temple leaves you with a nice feeling.
the poojas are conducted with a lot of devotion
the temple complex also has a wing that sells useful merchandise - all with sri krishna's pictures.
they also sell prasadam which comprises of a variety of food stuffs. one can easily have his stomach full and compensate for a good regular meal.
facility for parking cars is good.
there are a lot of steps but one could manage even with handicaps as there are lifts. even strollers could be taken.
it totallly is worthwhile to visit and fulfill ones appetite literally and also spiritually",1
Serene environment and extremely awesome view coupled with the cool weather. Amazing construction of the temple and excellent paintings.,1
"A place that recalls you every time you got stressed.. all day long u can stay hear and not feel bored... good restaurant for food also.. do not miss 8pm pallaki ustasv.
After that a tasty prashad .
So many things to purchase as a gift small theatre also.",1
"Its a very big temple, it has 100 steps but we didnt feel that we are climbing 100 steps as in between there are small temples and everything is nicely arranged and planned.",1
People are queued to avoid inconvenience. It provides parking and free foods (parasad) to all visitors. It looks very beautiful in golden color in evening.,1
"Iskcon Temple , beautiful place to visit . Let it be a temple ,nothing like seeing a beautiful place lighted up , clean , so systematic step by step . I felt really peaceful.
Right at the top the prayers with krishna songs going on and I saw devotees dancing to their glory . My stress was released , I felt like wanting to dance with them .
Really felt very calm and happy when I was leaving the place . Would like to go back again .",1
"Iskcon is a must place to visit in Bangalore. It is a peaceful & calm with devotional chanting of Hare Rama Hare Krishna mantra continuously, makes you forget all other things and perceive Lord Krishna's name.",1
Take a good sleep. Take a bath. Be there by 8 am. Don't look at any body. Just pray mentally. Spend at least one hour. Come out. Have a cup of sambar rice given free as Prasad. That's all folks. You will remember for a long time,1
When you visit the temple during morning Aarti time you will have awesome experience and you will forget all things.,1
I visited Iskcon temple on the night of Janmashtami. It was a wonderful experience. Only thing which I would recommend the authorities is to provide a better view of the lord idol,1
"One of the finest & well maintained temples.clean.
Visitors & devotees will have a great time in Iskcon.",1
"At the outset,I must confess ,being a little biased ,as I am a Life Member of ISCKON.But,having seen in Delhi,Mumbai,Kolkatta ,Tirupathi, by far ,Bangalore ISCKON gives the visitor a surreal experience. The mere size of the Sanctum Sanctorium and the contrasting silence,inside, punctuated by the chanting of hymns by the devotees during Puja hours is a treat to sore eyes and music,a pleasant experience to our ears. A sense of peace and solitude hits us ,once we are inside. Add to this,the daily Maha Arathy are a grand affair and the Prasadam is something to relish.Altigether a wonderful experience for adults and children alike and a must visit on the tour map of Bangalore.",1
"I went there in 2011. it was a beautiful place to see whole the temple. monuments are very clean & clear.
Prasada was best in taste. It was on top of the Hills looking very attractive from the ground.
you can see the city from the top of the Temple very beautifully. I recommend to visit the place one when you are in Bangalore.",1
"I know ISKON since child hood i have been to ISKON, Mayapur WB and Bangalore. The only thing i saw is how people converted there worship into business and i can see money is floating around the temple campus. You can say ISKON temples are market more than a temple. better you donate 500 rupee to a needy.",1
Give peace to your mind and come out from Stressed life. Life has become a machine and visiting here will make you feel like a human. For couples You will feel like home far away from home.,1
"Situated in the hubdrub of the city, this oasis of peace calm and cleanliness comes across as a welcome change. The size of the establishment can surprise you, but its very well organised despite huge crowds (specially on specific religious days). Worth admiring is the fact that almost all the people helping out are doing it gratis out of love for the faith and it shows.The structure, idols etc in themselves are nice but what you would expect in any large temple in India.worth a visit!!",0
"i've visited this place few times. if you want less crowd visit during day time. if it's crowded, they've have option for group darshan. this ticket will help reduce the time of darshan. after darshan you can visit all the stalls and prasad counters",0
A visit to this place in the evening is very beautiful. Its crowded during the weekends so the best time to visit is weekdays.. The prasad is mind blowingly super tasty!!!,0
"This is better than all the temples of Iscon I could visit so far. It is even better than Mathura Temple.
Garbh Grih hall with Krishna Radha Idol is mesmerising.
Radhe Radhe",1
Must visit place for Lord Krishna Devotees. Hare Krishna. Its one of the beautiful hindu temples in bangalore. It is close to Orion Mall.,1

"ISKON temple is situated in crowded place but there is ample parking space available inside the campus. Once inside you have two options for entry inside the temple either in general queque which is free or in vip queue by paying 400 rupees for whole family.
On a typical religious day there will be lot of rush but even in general queque it doesn't take more than 45 minutes before you reach the main temple.
If you are lucky then you can join Aarti. Inside of temple is really beautiful and well managed. While returning you can grab Gita in many languages.
On ground floor there is food court and exhibition of artifacts. Then finally Prasadam is distributed for everyone.
Overall this temple is a must visit place in Bangalore.",0
This is what one gets to chant and meditate when visiting this temple. a peaceful and a nice place. the temple architecture is state of the art and the temple is located on the hill top. the chants keep you calm.,1
"Most people will have mixed views of Iskcon temples. I am no different. Which explains why I have taken a week to write. Fortunately, my views haven't changed.

Yes, ISKCON temples have a severe commercialization angle to almost everything tangible or otherwise. Yes, ISKCON temples have changed with the affluent times.

What has not changed? why have I still rated it very high? The answer is that their standards are still very high. They still maintain one of the most important aspects of a temple, cleanliness! Scoring very high on Shaucha is something very critical for devotees and spiritual seekers as they take this unsaid message home. one's mind tends to become clean and so our environment and even our decisions... albeit for a small period of time. But that's why one needs to keep renewing our vows for cleanliness. The satsangs are also still old school and that's a real positive.

Definitely go there once in a month, spend some money there. For they do spend wisely on the AKSHAYA PATRA program. One's own wealth becomes purified. Their goshalas are also very nicely maintained. They are not all Desi cows. But the cows are treated very kindly and that's a real consolation considering what we are doing to get milk from cows nowadays!",1
A place full of positive vibes. It brings in a lot of positive energy. Must visit if you are in Bangalore. The architecture is great too.,1
Hare rama - Krishna chant echoes the temple . Peaceful and serene place. you have free darshan and paid darshan. you have a restaurant inside the premises and food court to taste your buds. Plan your visit in the night(after 6.30 pm) where you can view the harathi for the idols . it would be very delightful to view this.,1

Hare Krishna! Sarvam Krishnarpanam!!",1

A must visit place in Bangalore. U can find almost every religious books with different language's",1
"Janmashtami is the day Lord Krishna was born who is also the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu.
This auspicious occasion is celebrated by millions in the country with abundance of joy.

The Sri Krishna Janamashtani this year was celebrated on the 14th and 15th of August, 2017.

Where better to rejoice the birth of Lord Krishna than visit the ISKON temple and seek the blessing of Lord Krishna. Here, the festival is celebrated with hundreds of devotees thronging the temple premises to offer their respects to the Lord.

This time we planned to visit the ISKON at the Chord road, Rajaji Nagar which is at a distance of about 15-16 kilometers from our place at JP Nagar.
We opted for the Namma Metro from the JayaPrakash Nagar Metro Station to the Mahalaksni Metro Station which is the nearest metro station to the ISKON temple. From the metro station at Mahalaskhmi, you can catch a cab or walk about a distance of 1 kilometer or so to reach the temple.
I swear the Namma Metro makes commuting easy and hassle free - the journey which would have taken us about above an hour by our car, took us about 30 minutes minus no wait time or traffic - such relief. üòé
It took us about 30 to 45 minutes to reach the main chamber where the Lord resides after passing the long queues.

As you enter, the continuous chants of

""Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Ram Hare Ram, Ram Ram Hare Hare',

makes you feel so connected to the Lord.

The holy shrine of the Lord is offered 108 special different kinds of bhog on this day. Along with it, is prepared tons of sweet pongal which is distributed among the devotees as they exit the temple.
The entire temple is cleaned and the deities are decorated and adorned with jewellery and flowers - it is just divine. That one glimpse of the lord will touch your soul.
From their official site, the deities of Sri Radha Krishnachandra are anointed with fragrant oils and bathed with auspicious items like milk, yogurt,ghee, honey,sweet water and fresh juices.They are then smeared with turmeric paste and bathed in Ganges water. Varieties of flowers are showered until the deities are submerged in a bed of flowers.

The chamber where the Lord resides - is just gleaming in gold - mesmerizing.
The residing deities are - Sri Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Sri Krishna Balarama and Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga.
There are two smaller temples housing the deities of Sri Srinivasa Govinda, Sri Prahlada Narashimha,Sri Hanuman and Sri Garuda Deva.

There is such happiness flowing around - totally gives you a positive vibe. üôä

I must say they temple authorities try to manage the queue and facilitate well.

There are tokens available for special darshan. We went in the general queue, the long queues could be tiring - but patience is the key. As you walk through - they have a shoe stand mid way, where you need to put your shoes in a bag against which you would get a token. As you progress further - there is a provision for washing your hands and feet too.
Have your darshan and walk out to bowl full of yummy sweet pongal. üòã

On the occasion of Janmashtami, the temple was open through the day.
Otherwise if you visit, there are darshan timings as below, from their official site:

Weekdays:
7:15 - 13:00
16:15 - 20:15

Weekends/Public Holiday:
7:15 - 20:15

Once you darshan is over, starts the plethora of shops selling bhog items, snack items, photos frames, cloth, scents, incent sticks.

We took the DIL PASAND, priced at Rs.25/- - with flour covering which was baked and stuffed with coconut stuffing with loads tutty fruity - yeay!!
The PAKODA, priced at Rs.30/-was okay-ish, made with cabbage leaves and besan. I did not enjoy it, since it was dead cold.
The GUJIYAS,priced at Rs.20/- were delicious with khoya stuffing - my god!!
They sell food items ranging from samosas, kachodi, gulab jamuns, rosgullas, cookies, ladoos. Enjoy!

Don't:
Don't leave your footwear outside, there is a provision as you walk through for your darshan - free of charge.
Don't carry standalone camera - they do have a provision of leaving your belongings.
Don't carry baggage - only hand bags allowed.
Don't wear objectionable clothing.
Cheers to life!!

One of the biggest ISKCON temples in India and its located on a hill and very beautiful. It has got its own prasadam area where one can have different types of food and snacks. It has also got its own parking.,1
"No matter you are religious or not, you will have positive vibes when you will visit a temple.

Iskon temple is built with only stone with delicious painting the lord Krishna is extraordinary with his wife and the lighting is excellent at the night,1
"Visited this temple in the evening slot. Temple opens about 4:15 pm or so. steady stream of visitors were lining up. we waded through the security and reached the place where we can keep our footwear. BTW, it is a neat system. After that it was a long walk to the temple through walkways. The first darshan was of Prahlada Narasimha, followed by Srinivasa Perumal and then finally the golden temple of Radhe-Krishna. The main temple is superb in its internal structure. Ceiling is full of Krishna paintings. The structure where the idols are housed is covered with gold. In the center you have people rendering bhajans continuously. It was a atmosphere of devotion, you can feel the goosebumps. The exit path is through stalls, many of them.
We picked up prashad on the way out. It was a great experience.

Some points to note:
a) Photography inside temple is not allowed. You could take some snaps at the main dwara and after that you see the signs prohibiting photography. Do not carry your cameras
b) Formal dressing is expected and is mentioned every where. When i say formal - no half-pants or sweat pants or that sort of thing. Men and Women to take care of dressing
c) Some areas completely open, if raining, you are likely to get wet.

Rest, just enjoy Radhe-krishna's hospitality.",1
A peaceful place...a clean and well maintained place to go along with family or friends for mental peace,1
"Located at chord road, Hare Krishna Hill, Bengaluru. Nicely decorated temple of Lord Krishna. It is devine and religious place of Hinduism. Best time to visit on the time of Aarati.

The Temple is walking distance from Metro Station Mahalakshmi .In the temple do walk on marble and chant Hare Rama Hare Krishna mantras for 108 times. it will be a wonderful experience .

This is one of the best temples in bengaluru. Highly recommended place to visit in bengaluru. Metro also available in this area.,1
"Although the architecture of this temple is very impressive, to me it has lost it's spirituality. It seems to be more about the vendors selling goods.",1
A calm and peaceful place with a mix of modern and traditional architecture. Needs substantial climb up the stairs but absolutely worth the work.,1
"ISKCON Temple is a beautiful place in Bangalore and it is a ""Must Visit"" place for locals as well as tourists and foreigners. The temple is accessible to all people irrespective of cast, creed or religion. The temple itself is an architectural marvel, well maintained and clean.

A pious and holy place to visit ....Lord Krishna temple (isckon temple) in siliguri really felt blessed with family and kids....,0
"Well maintained temple in Bangalore, very silent place to worship, beginning to end well managed and maintained temple, only this i felt disappoint is there is lots of commercial activities inside the temple, selling merchandise items and food courts inside the temple itself, to maintain the divine inside temple premises commercial activities should be avoided, must visit place in Bangalore.",1
It is very good with carvings all over the inside. should check the timings of the temple as darshan timings are fixed.,1
"Krishna Temple , Top of a small hill. Main gate is at the bottom. Very organized Temple. They do give Bhog also .",1
Temple almost floods with devotees during special occasions like Janmashtami. Every day free meals served here for visitors which is very hygienic and tasty.,1
"Not much money looting, as can be seen at some other temples. You can have a decent darshan at temple, very peaceful environment.",1
"Must visit while in Bangalore. Very beautiful build up in Southern Temple Architecture with white marble. Night views are amazing. Darshan of Gold Idol inside the main temple, takes you to the unkown level, its a different feeling. By paying Rs 300/- the whole family may offer personalised puja by giving name and gotra. You will recive 2 pkets of prasad after puja.
For entering the temple, they have a very organised barricaded Que system, keeping your shoes and entering the temple by washing your feet. It will take 15 mins to climb up the temple and you require at least 2 hrs to see the temple nicely on week days, non busy hrs. On celebration or on week days position not sure. There are number of food stalls. Also like all other Isckon they have restaurent which offers buffet lunch & dinner on payment of Rs.550/- per head.",0
"This is the best tourist spot in Bangalore and almost accessible by all means of transport within bangalore.....Buses, Metro station, Car etc
The temple is located at a hill and offers fantastic view of the city. The spiritual visit can well be coupled with good recreational aspects for the kids.....food...shopping etc.
Overall a MUST VISIT spot when you are in Bangalore",1
"Murthis inside the temple starting from Chanting Harerama Harekrishna mantra in the entrance till the exit where all the shopping district is there.. Everything is beautiful and absolutely amazing. The food (prasada) you get is super tasty and the motichoor laddu you get there is nowhere to be found in Bangalore. You get immersed in devotional bliss by watching Lord Narasimha, Lord Venkateswara (Balaji) & Radha Krishna, Balarama Krishna & Shri Prabhupada.. Must visit once in life.",1
"Really nice temple, must visit. Very neat clean and well maintained. you can buy a good spiritual books and other stuff from here.",1
Good to spend 2hours any day. You need 15 minutes to climb up and 15min to climb down on a non busy days. Neat and calm. They also have a restaurant. If you are done early then you can always visit nearby orion mall or plenty of other temples nearby.,1

This temple in Bangalore city is so beautiful with good decoration & well managed organisation that provides devotees of lord Krishna a good place to great blessings and finally a very good place to visit.,1
"This is the temple everyone in Bengaluru seems very proud of. Personally I thought it was overrated, too modern for me, I preferred other older temples as well as the modern Shiva temple. it is however a big monument, where you can see Hindus in prayer and giving offerings so it is an interesting experience.",1
It was a amazing experience to visit the ISKCON temple. The main temple sits at the top of the city. It gives peace of mind and I did spend more time than I had thought of. Amazing view sitting inside the main temple. On way out of the temple there are a no. of eating options within the premises and also wonderful buffet spread in the restaurant named Higher taste.,1
"A must visit. The atmosphere is so amazing. Very well organised and controlled, looking at the amount of people coming to visit.
Good puja arrangements. Lots of lovely things to buy and eat. A nice day out for Krishna devotees.
Parking an issue on festival days.",1
Beautiful temple and it is a must see in Bangalore. But be aware that you have to climb many stairs otherwise it is worth to see.,1
"Magnificent. Neat , clean and atmosphere is pious . Visited number of times and when ever we are in Bangalore, we make it to visit this temple. We feel blessed. One should visit this temple.

But one aspect make us feel a bit odd and doesn't suit the sacred atmosphere of the devine place.., ie. eating / food stalls and shops of all nature. This is giving a commercial look to the place.",0
"Awesome place to see, feel the peaceful atmosphere and calm your mind.. The prasdam offered is very tasty and the place is kept very clean..",1
"Best place to spend time with family which can give us not only a spiritual experience, but also a fun place to have variety food (served as Prasad), magnificent view of the city from the hill top and a pleasant walk through the gardens and the fountain! The Bangalore metro to reach this spot now is an added advantage!

Don't forget to buy some nice souvenir.",1
Its a very beautiful temple . if u are a tourist . there is metro station very near to it. It has canteens and all othet facility,1
Visited with friends on 12 Aug 2017. Not much to do for non-Hindu people. Shorts and cloths with body reavealing are not allowed. One of us who wore a pair of shorts was asked to deposit Rs 500 with a fee of Rs 20 for lungi. People inside the Temple were very friendly though.,1
The way you go deep inside of temple you feel positive vibes and coolness in your body. Hare rama hare Krishna tune will brighten up your mind and refreshing the body.,1
"very disciplined and systematic darshan!
Prasad is great!
This place also has pure vegetarian restaurant where the food is awesome.",1
Wear something respectful here! Shorts are not suitable. Beautiful temple a place of prayer and repose. Worth spending some time here.,1
"We visited the Iskcon temple with our two kids. Its has steps leading up to the main temple that might be a little tiring for the old folks. However, nice breeze blows all the time, especially during the evenings when the temple is well lighted. It's dedicated to Lord Krishna but has idols of other deities too. After having the main darshan and coming down the steps, there are small shops selling local savories and snacks, toys, religious books, pictures, idols and a whole variety of items. At the end of the steps, you get piping hot Prasadam in the form of Pongal/ khichdi/ sambhar rice. Outside the main temple but within its premises, there's a sattvic restaurant named Higher Taste. It has a buffet that's worth tasting once since all items on the menu are made without using onion and garlic, though prices are on a tad higher side. Would recommend visiting the temple at least once.",1
"Its a beautiful temple....one of the biggest and most royal temples in the world....u will feel great....if you are pressed for time, please do not go thru the chanting line as it takes a long time...go on a empty stmach...because the free prasad is lipsmacking....and also there is a huge spread of food stuff at the end of the temple....u get great foods here....cannot believe such a large variety of food in a temple...enjoy....",1
"Lord krishna's temple. Worth visiting once. Nice temple.
It's located in North Bangalore, near yashwanthpur area.",1
Religious place..nice place to visit for elderly people and also for the who are inclined towards religion.,1
"Far different from the temples and temple complexes that we have seen in our life. But even though a modern ambiance and architecture, the divinity is not lost a bit with 'Hare Rama, Hare Krishna' reverberating in ones ears and soul once we are in.",1
"Since my childhood i was always attracted towards the fantasies of Krishna, I was a believer back then , although now my liking towards mother nature and the whole existence and taken over the likes of Gods and Goddesses, yet the fact is the time i visited Iskon temple I used to be a great believer in deity worship. For the first time when i went there i was excited and blindly devoted because i have always loved to visit temples , the peace that i get in the chanting of manthras and the smell of Agarbathis and Camphor and not to leave behind the very structures of the idols and the temples have mesmerized me and continue to do so. now coming to Isckon. The whole of Isckon temple is like a MALL meant for shopping and looking around. The priests look and talk like they have everyday meeting with Lord Krishna and only they are the rightful devotees of Krishna. Apart from that they treat you like school kids with discipline routines like chanting while getting into the temple. The idols within Isckon are like showcase material and i would not recommend anyone who is expecting a peaceful retreat of a temple at this complex. Good luck",1
"I visit iskcon very frequently, the place is nice & tidy always, It look more beautiful during night with the lights on, it always has some activities going on & filled with devotees...",1
The temple adorns a beautiful idol of Lord Krishna - Radha and also a huge prayer hall. I would like the place better if they had a separate place to sell food and other products as it makes the place look very commercialised.,1

"Clean Temple with Good Architecture with a Beautiful View of Bangalore

A must visit place when in Bangalore

Has a very good Restaurant",1
"It is a must visit for all - whether you are religious or not. I went there with my family on a Sunday morning in April. Most of whom were religious.
If you are religious, it is a beautifully built temple which makes you feel peaceful. You are made to chant on each step, patiently waiting in a long queue of devotees. When you reach inside, you can sit in the hall and it feels quiet and nice. You will come out feeling happy.
If you are not religious, its a beautifully managed place. You will see such great processes being used to control such a large crowd. No one is pushing or talking or littering. This is because you are made to chant at each step and just take one step at a time. You will come out feeling happy, having learnt a thing or two about religion.",1
Temple is made and organized in a grand way. At least I don't get a divine feeling when I visit because of the constant bustle and too many commercial activity going on. It's definitely worth a visit to experience the grandeur (with good appetite). You can fill yourself with the different prasads and there is full fledged restaurants within the compound.,1
"A well maintained,clean,calm place to visit.

Being there you feel very different and relaxed.
Crowd management is also very good.
Eateries are too good.
Many more things to explore there so in short a very nice place to visit with Family & Friends.",1
"This temple is a beautiful place to visit , especially in the evenings when the temple is illuminated",1
If you are looking for peace of mind and to get connected with lord this the place you can visit at any season. This temple is a must visit in bangalore.,0
"Place is huge, fancy, and if you let your imagination, you would think we are back in time. Interesting experience, full of completely different culture aspects (to me at least...) . I enjoyed the place....",1
"I had been this place with family, good Temple, clean and fresh. We have to wear Indian cloths, that's the good part in this Temple. Shorts not allowed.",1
"The tour guide , took us there it was centuries old , very Interesting . The Architecture of the building was the most interesting to us.",1
"Peaceful place in city life amazing architecture must visit place in Bangalore city .... evening lighting is good ...Prasad is very well prepared
There is shopping mall in side it of bhagwan",1
Iskon temple offers virtually everything for the spiritual aspiriant. Lovely opportunity to chant the Maha Mantra and climb the 108 steps to receive the Darshan of Lord Krishna.,1
Peacefull place to flow placidly away from shrieking crazy traffic woes. And let all your tensions slip away in a blissful place,1
"Like the people of faith. The prasadam
Do try the khichdi. The bakery food items. All organic food. Amazing in taste.",1
"Sit relax pray even the view from the temple is awesome,you will book fare inside where you can avail different kind of religious book,live counters.",1
"My first visit to this temple...in fact any of the large ISKON temples. The construction of the temple on the hill and the layout is absolutely amazing. However it is way too commercialized with the ""prasadam"" area selling more varieties of sweets, samosa and other stuff than any other temple I've ever visited. If you are after a quiet temple to sit and meditate/reflect then this is not your destination.",1
Nice Place to Visit.I enjoy a lot there with friend.I went there in Krishna Janmastami. Too much crowd is there in that day.,1
Beautiful temple of Lord Krishna and couple of other gods. Place is very peaceful and relaxing with animated movies show and shopping too.,1
It is a Radha Krishna Temple located at rajajinagar near North Bangalore. It is one of the largest iskon temples in the world. It is built in the year 1997,1
"Bangalore is known for his traffic jam and as a densely populated city, this city has very fewer places where you can have both family and silent place to have.
ISKCON Temple of Bangalore provides both to you.
A large place with a lot of spirituality which not only gives you a positive energy but also takes you out from the crowd of people full of tensions to a group of people with calm and strong minds.
A must visit place for everyone and also you can do lot more.
The charm of Lord Krishna and his dressing is unique.
You can also get lots of books on mythology and spirituality.
Free food is also one thing that adds this place to a uniqueness.",1
"Very nice and beautifull place to visit in fact a must visit for everyone, Evening aratis are a special treat",1
"Nice place to eat out, you've so many options to choose from. The discipline, cleanliness and the ambience is very well maintained here. Very cleanly atmosphere friendly treatment good food well organised.In short this is a beautiful temple.",1
"Visited this place with family on Sunday, it's near the world trade center. They seem to have ample parking, however the parking spots are all over the hillock on which the temple is built. They have kirtan in the evenings and have savoury food items which are pure vegetarian for sale as well. Spent a good couple of hours.",1
"LIke other ISKCON Temples, this place also has a lot of positivity in itself. The Management has done a very decent job in ensuring smooth visit for all the worshippers. The Positive vibes inside helps in meditation and overall positive flow of thoughts. Nice to see the donations are also accepted through PayTM....Overall nicely maintained. Do check the temple timings before visiting as it is closed for few hours everyday.",1
Very peaceful. Great place for chanting. Very easy to reach. One of the best temple of India i ever visited.,1
"First of all, one must know what ISKON stand for - ""International Society for Krishna Consciousness"" and I greatly thank ISKON for this great movement of spreading consciousness, vedic knowledge and the message of Lord Krishna all over the world. ISKON Bangalore is one of the largest ISKON temples in the world and is also one of the most popular religious site. The overall structure of the temple is spectacular, the surrounding area is clean and well maintained and of course the environment inside is very peaceful. I like the way you get Darshan in a very systematic and disciplined manner even when its too crowded, though if possible I prefer early morning hours(7-8 AM) to take Darshan of Lord Krishna since thats the freshest time of the day and also less crowded. At the end of Darshan, temple serves free khichadi Prasadam to all visitors. A needy can get a free lunch too - the facility provided by ISKON which is really appreciable.",1
"I had been to ISKON temple yesterday i.e., 21.07.2017. Orderly arrangements and marvelous construction fascinated me. The various poojas conducted there taken us to such a divine atmosphere. I felt positive vibrations there.",1
"nice temple to get peace of mind to avoid problems , the temple construction is attracts you ,very big temple , best to go in the evening ,if you go in the evening for temple you can enjoy the view of Bangalore city.",1
This is most beautiful Vishnu temple sit on a hill. Bangalore Metro made easy to travel this temple from many parts. The city view is spectacular from the temple. One can enjoy beautiful sunset from here. Temple spreads pure devotional and knowledge to all.,1
"Good place to visit when you have any visitors at home .. elderly will love it !
Unlike other temples this temple has a whiff of extravagance ! You can spend hours at this place .. the serene and spirituality at the main sanatorium will over whelm you !!
Better avoid this place during evening on weekends .. its gets overtly crowded !!
The entry is free .. but special Darshan and special entry will be with added cost .. this is not recommended ! Incase you are interested the place has shops where you can buy books , pictures , CD's and souvenirs !!
Overall a must visit place if you are visiting Bangalore !!",1
"I was inspired to visit ISKCON after reading the biography of Prabhupada .. though I have been in Bangalore for the last 17 years, I had not made an effort to visit the temple.. I took advantage of the trip of my close relatives from Delhi, all senior citizens, and we decided to spend the day at ISKCON ..we were pleasantly surprised to experience a place, so well organised, impeccably neat and clean, great eye for details, most polite and helpful staff and volunteers, calm, peaceful and soul searching.. the arrangements for senior citizens have been made with great care and compassion.. after spending two hours in the Main Temple, we had the privilege of a very simple and delicious lunch in the cafeteria/canteen at a nominal price(we did not utilise the option of complimentary meal) .. a must visit for one and all",1
"This is a very large and popular temple, so best to visit when it first opens in the morning. There is an attendant to hold your shoes, and be aware of the dress code before you go: long pants (no shorts) and no bare shoulders. They will have some fabric in case you need to cover up. Also, no photography allowed. The buildings don't take too terribly long to get through if you're just going for a look. It is beautiful inside. The main temple area is large and open, and there is a shop with books off to the side. As you're leaving, you'll pass by several areas with food for sale.",1
"This Iskon temple is one better than other Iskons. I mustn't compare a temple but the building is so.
Situated on a mini hill covering all of it. Quite big enough to spend good 2 hours here. Radhe Krishna temple in the mid of it and other than it there is a shopping place in between your darshan walk where you can buy all hand made products paintings crafts etc. Sweets are also sold here.
The place is free from noise and should you wish to meditate for a while it is a nice place for it.
Mahalakshmi metro station is very close by . Must visit.",1
"It's iconic temple, very peaceful & quite Place, little bouddha are so cute looking and good place for inner peace, lots of greenery, Prasad is so tasty, good to visit with friends and family. Do visit once you will never regret.",1

Amazing place for a religious visit. Fantastic ambience. Cost of food available is on the higher side but it is of nice taste.",1
Devotional place. Nice view . One good place for tourists when visiting Bengaluru. Radhakrishna temple,1

"Its easier to reach the place via metro, the station is less than a kilometer far. The temple is on the top of a hill, the view is good from the metro train than from the temple gate itself. Its a well managed temple which looks more like an urban structure than a traditional temple. You need some amount of patience as quite some time has to be spent in queues. As you climb the steps there are smaller sanctoriums of Narasimha swamy and Balaji. Inside the main hall there are a few altars dedicated to Krishna, Radha and Balaram. You can sit and relax there for some time listening to the Bhajans. There are quite a number of shops selling various stuffs from religious books to eatables which can be considered as prasada and also a super market. It can be considered for a half day outing.",1
Nothing more to say - it's a breathtakingly beautiful building with a peaceful message. Lovely people. Good parking and great organisation of queues,1

Temple is peaceful place to sit and relax. There are some restrictions on attire you wear so make you follow them else there are alternate arrangements at the temple. prasad etc is also good. Worth a visit with parents.,1
"This temple is the one of best place in Bangalore, go at night to see the view of this temple in very good glow with lights. Food also nice to taste once.",1
"Depending on your belief you will either hate or love this place. Traditionally in India Temples/Mosques do not have ticket systems. The massive crowds in some places of high veneration justify a ticket system . This place does not qualify for the pilgrimage category. The temple is well managed and clean , but fails to impress. Do not go with small kids on weekends and on festival days. i came back having ticked off a local attraction on my list. There's no urge to go back.",1
"I have been to ISKCON temple multiple times and it always stikes me how well maintained the place is. It is certainly a great place to calmly spend half-a-day visiting the shrines and the great central hall as well as browse the prasadam and other delicacies for sale.

Of late I also attended a couple of family functions there and was pleasantly surprised by the arrangements and staff there.",1
"One of the beautiful place of worship and peace. Amazing and stunning view of Bangalore city. They will provide nice hot prasadam at the end of the temple visit If you are in a hurry you can buy 516/- ticket for family for quick Darshan. If you are not in hurry you can chant "" Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" along with the group for 108 times.
Overall it gives wonderful experience. They have parking and accommodations.",1
Expect lot of crowd. A bit commercialised I felt. You have to climb up to see the core temple. And everything is made of gold once you reach the inner temple.,1

This is a beautiful temple located on a small hillock in middle of city on a busy road. This is to be visited more for grandure and soffistication. Very clean and maintained very meticously.

"It's a lovely place; too commercialized, to crowded for a person looking for a peaceful spiritual journey!
But is one of the more entertaining temples one can visit: good shopping complex, lively bhajans, great restaurant, disciplined staff, well maintained infrastructure...
It is just sad that it has turned into a visiting place instead of a place for seekers - however, being attractive, it is a good place to initiate children into temple...!
Enjoy the place!",1
"Located in a very nice place and in a walkable distance from Mahalaxmi metro station.One of the best Iskon temple in the World. One can find book shops and many other shops for different kind of goods and foods.The temple trustee except cards and Paytm so no worries if u don't have cash.
Visit in the evening and u can enjoy the closing CEREMONY with surprise dance from devotees.",1
"Hi tech temple, nice place to visit and learn about Krishna's mythology. The organisation does excellent work in feeding school children through its Akshayapatra scheme. supplies nutritious vegetarian mid day meals to a number of schools.

has an excellent restaurant in its premises which serves excellent satvic food.",1
"The sculptures, structure are all truly reflecting the temple architectural beauty of South India. Devotion is ultimate. Swamy Prabhupada lives here eternally, seeking Lord Krishna's blessings for all His devotees.
I would say this is one among the best of ISKCON temples.",1
A very beautiful temple. Well maintained and has good views from the top. The food here is a must try and is reasonably priced.,1
"This temple is too much commercial. When you enter, they will ask for special ticket. Inside temple, they sell Books and Prasadam. A team will be waiting for you to ask for donations. The moment you start coming out, you will find huge market with costly items for sale including food items. You can spend time shopping and trying multiple food items.",1
"Perhaps this place is worth a visit, but less from a cultural than a socio-political viewpoint. Marriage of religion with commercialism - Hindu variant. Very busy place. If you need to choose for a visit, pick the quieter solemn ancient temples.",1
Krishna Hare Krishna all over the place and makes you more glued to your beliefs. I love to visit this always,1
"A word to describe this temple is ""mesmerizing"". The rich golden figurine & its structure is simply amazing to see in the main temple. There is a long way to reach by climbing many steps - if you like walking. Climbing & walking through the 3 temples converts you to a solemn person.",1
"quite a spiritual place; enjoyed the walking through the temple and the blessings received. Enjoyed the experience immensely, thumbs up for a view on different cultural / religious site.",1
"I went many times with family and friends. It is one of the best temples. Except the crowded market place at the end, it's very peaceful. Specially if you go in the morning when they open it is awesome. It's a must visit place",1
"Must visit place in Bangalore. You can spend atlest 3 hours here. Has a very warm feel. If interested, you could buy some devotional books here as well",1
"ISKCON at Bangalore is like a haven of peace and piety, amidst the hustle and bustle of a busy cosmopolitan city. The air itself calls out 'Krishna', even if the taped chants of 'Hare Krishna' weren't played at a loop.
The first thing that strikes one about the temple, is the breathtaking majesty of its facade - this is one of the most beautifully designed Krishna temples ever! Situated high above a hill, so be prepared for climbing stairs, the Temple itself commands a panoramic view of the city, from the right side of the sanctum area. Remember the dress code and wear covered clothes - I was in a shortsleeved dress, so wore long pajamas underneath to cover up. Also check the temple's timings before you go, it closes during the afternoon.
There are toilet facilities (a bit better than primitive) that can be used if there is an absolute need to go. Shoes can be checked in at the shoe racks (hold your nose though, because that area smells of feet!), but to me, the best part is the luggage counter, because you can visit the temple and then go straight to the airport/railway station if you're so minded.
There are a 108 steps that one is advised to stop at and chant the complete 'Hare Krishna' mantra for awakening inner consciousness and focusing on Krishna. Two smaller sanctums devoted to 'Prahalada' and 'Prabhupada', lead you on to the majestic main sanctum, which is done up in gold and will elicit an audible wow from most first timers.
Onwards from the 'darshan', and there is a book counter, and the exit ways lead to other halls where one can purchase jaap maalas (Hindu rosaries), crystal trees, incense and essential oils, and a whole lot of other things besides. There is a lovely bakery too, and a proper Cafe, aptly names 'The Higher Consciousness'. Free prasadam that's basically made of sweetened tapioca pearls, and you can then take your leave, or stay for longer.

It took me about an hour, at a rush, including the 108 chants, so perhaps one would be better advised to keep aside atleast a couple of hours for this beautiful sanctuary of inner consciousness.

Hari bol!",1
"Although this is a very posh place, there a lot of stalls in this place placed in a zig-zag fashion. Thus, whenever you are leaving after the Darshan, they try to sell you stuff and make profit out of it. Please avoid falling for such tactics.",1
Architecture is good. Temple premise is full of devotional flavour. The exit route having too many stalls seem to be a spoil spot though. Had hard time to figure out which restaurant serve nice Satvik buffet meal after darshanam. Prasad queue went little unmanaged despite all efforts by management staff.,1
"One of the best temple visited in recent times and the maintenance is super.
Must visit to spend some time for a peace of mind",1
"One of the hill located on west of chord road, Bangalore;
The Iskcon Temple is one of the must visits in Bangalore;
but some times feel like in a commercial place rather than a temple",1
"Paid a visit during a business trip.
If I can give you one tip: you can buy a vip ticket to bypass the lines.",1
This temple of Lord Krishna is Beautiful. The architecture is awesome. You would feel peaceful. There is option for some shopping and food.,1
"We visited the temple today evening and for me it is a second visit after 13 years . A sight of Hare Krishna at top of the temple is just like a feel at heaven. Well maintained and organized temple.

Post darshan, there is plenty to eat &shop around -prasadan stall offers plenty of snacks which are to be paid , besides their traditional awesome prasadam.

Today being a sunday heavey crowded but neverthless well organized -excellent parking facility.

Worthy weekly visit for those close by and must visit for tourist to experience the blissful feel.
Hare Krishna",1

Do visit the site to feel refreshed from all thoughts of your mind after chanting 108 times the mantra of Lord Krishna,1
ISKCON Temple Bangalore is sort of an icon in Bangalore. Temple is very beautiful located on a hill but it can get really crowded here.,1
"The Krishna idols was the only thing that was good at this place. This place was so much commercial almost everything is sold here. The pathway to the temple and also the way out is dotted with shops selling food and prasadam.
The whole idea of spiritual walk went for a toss.",1
"A big temple with beautiful details. The exiting though is quite troublesome, make sure you're not in a rush. You will have to go through all kinds of stores and stands before you can exit.",1
"Everyday Morning
4:15 am to 5:00 am
Monday to Friday:
7:15 am to 1:00 pm
4:15 pm to 8:15 pm

Saturdays, Sundays & Public Holidays:

This temple complex is not only grand but also well organized The lord krishna idol is mesmerizing. I feel visit to Bengaluru without the visit to this temple is incomplete.,1
"Golden idols of Lord Krishna, Radha and Balaram are beautiful and main shrine of the temple. Inside the temple you will get in touch with your spiritual self by constant chanting of 'hare rama hare krishna'. Nice place for meditation.
Do try eateries available inside temple especially jalebis and bhajias. Prasadam i.e khichdi is ultimate here.
Also books on Krishna are well illustrated.
Overall a calm and spiritual modern temple.",1
when you enter the premises you get a feel of being in a godly place. you hear the chants of the bhakti sangeet and i am sure you will hummm along. dont forget to take the prasadam . also try their higher taste restaurant .,1

"The Krishna idols was the only thing that was good at this place. This place was so much commercial almost everything is sold here. The pathway to the temple and also the way out is dotted with shops selling food and prasadam.
The whole idea of spiritual walk went for a toss.",0
"A big temple with beautiful details. The exiting though is quite troublesome, make sure you're not in a rush. You will have to go through all kinds of stores and stands before you can exit.",1
"Everyday Morning
4:15 am to 5:00 am
Monday to Friday:
7:15 am to 1:00 pm
4:15 pm to 8:15 pm

Saturdays, Sundays & Public Holidays:

This temple complex is not only grand but also well organized The lord krishna idol is mesmerizing. I feel visit to Bengaluru without the visit to this temple is incomplete.,0
"Golden idols of Lord Krishna, Radha and Balaram are beautiful and main shrine of the temple. Inside the temple you will get in touch with your spiritual self by constant chanting of 'hare rama hare krishna'. Nice place for meditation.
Do try eateries available inside temple especially jalebis and bhajias. Prasadam i.e khichdi is ultimate here.
Also books on Krishna are well illustrated.
Overall a calm and spiritual modern temple.",1
when you enter the premises you get a feel of being in a godly place. you hear the chants of the bhakti sangeet and i am sure you will hummm along. dont forget to take the prasadam . also try their higher taste restaurant .,1
"Very nicely designed and maintained temple, evenings are awesome. Their hararhis are must see, reach 30 mins before so that you will reach inside on time",1
"Heavenly experience in the beginning when you walk on the steps chanting Hare Krishna. Very quiet and disciplined place , need to walk in the queue only. Beautiful darshan of all deities. Need to buy Prasad for the offering. You can spend quality time participating in the prayers. Later while coming back you will find a big market where all religious books and different deities are sold in metal. It is noisy there, sellers will call you sometime to buy the stuff, next is the eating corner where you find all the junk. Food is little expensive comparatively, enjoy eating it while standing.",1
Whoever visiting to Bangalore should visit this place. Very nice place to go there. You can enjoy with family. I will always visit there when anyone from my hometown come here to Bangalore,1
"The temple is a marvelous and well-maintained temple campus! A huge one, must see for anyone in Bangalore and those visiting Bangalore! North Indian style of idols and pooja practice! Lots of parking space with restaurant inside the temple campus. One for sure gets that divine feeling when you join the chanting in the main hall of the temple sitting in front of Lord Krishna and Rukmini matha!",0
"WOW!!! This is the first thought that would come to your mind as soon as you see this graceful temple. Your senses come to a halt as soon as you step inside the main shrine and you feel like its a heavenly abode. Hand and Leg washing facilities are provided at the entrance where your Bags and Footwear are supposed to be stored. Only visit this temple if you have at least 2-3 hours to spare. Amazing deity exhibitions and temple infrastructure. It has a few shops that sell Krishna deities and accessories for the devotees, and there also a eatery near the exit of the temple that serves south Indian delicacies .",1
A Nice heartwarming place to visit. And also the prasad is great here. Great to be religious sometimes ;).,1
Feeling blessed. Suggest everyone to visit this place . Iskon has gold platted dhwaja stambha and shikara which is amazing . Also Sri Krishna pasadam which tastes awesome.,1
"If you have been to Akshardham temple in Delhi or Gandhi Nagar you will have the same deja vu while visiting Iskcon Bangalore. Its not as huge Akshardham nevertheless the facilities , the discipline of devotees and the maintenance is same

Best way to reach is Metro Green Line. Have a station 500 m from Iskcon. You are connected to Majestic , Bangalore City station , Malleswaram and Jayanagar ... So no need to rush through and drive through the city traffic near majestic and city railway station

You have a lot of sales activities whether its books , art work or food happening. It may be slightly be irritating as you have to pass through to all finally come out. However its a nice walk and no soliticiation happens. Good to see the stores and all infact

Wear something comfortable .. Jeans and T shirt may not be great. But a nice shirt and pant is allowed. They dont look too strict on dress code

Have a nice darshan , Meet communities , feel happy !!!",1
"I have visited this beautiful temple 3-4 times till now. It's a marvellous piece of architecture constrcuted with white marbels. Because, the temple is located at a small hilltop, the view from the temple to the overlooking road is very pleasent. The atmosphere inside is truly divine and soothes the mind and soul. You can take the blessings of Lord Krishna and know about the Vaishnava culture.
There is a book stall from where you can purchase holy books for reading. The temple has a canteen and shopping area where you can feed yourself with a variety of vegetarian food and buy some handicraft material as well.
This temple offers everything you look for on a weekend outing. It's peaceful and divine. The only flip side is that the temple remains very crowded during weekends and other festivals. However, looking at the popularity of it, that should be fine.",1
"Must visit for peace..place for all.family with elders & Kids,friends, Relatives.In crowd also you find peace.",1
A beautiful calm and well maintained peace filled relaxed place in Bangalore and must visit to get Lord Sri Krishna blessings,1
"ISKCON temple is sucha place where you can feel real peace of mind. the infrastructure is like so big & nice.
You here all chanting Hare rama! Hare Krishna! till you move inside the temple it's alike 108 times.

Thank you",1
"Exquisite temple at Hare Krishna hill on Chord road, it's pure bliss as one enters the sanctum sanatorium to behold Sri Radharani and Sri Krishna idols who are very intricately decorated with minute attention to details. Add to it the chants of Lord's glory echoing through the huge hall having beautiful murals depicting the pass times of Krishna. Seems as if it's real or everything is a passing dream not to be woken up. Pure bliss.

One can buy the special darshan tickets for group of 4 or 6 person, which entitles speedy darshan including at Narasimha, Balaji and finally the Radha Krishna along with Nitai Gauranga and Krishna Balarama in main temple, by passing the queues. This pass also gives privilege to offer prayers (archana) and take prasads and books.

However I would recommend going in normal queue, which gives the privilege of chanting ""Hare Krishna"" mantra 108 times with other devotees as one climbs to the temple.

Everyone is served a bowl of prasad at the exit and on Sundays it's lunch (satvik and tasty). However there are many snack items available just before the exit one can buy, like samosa, kachori, rasagola, gulab jamuns, pizza slices, burgers, sandwiches, juice. Souvenir shops aplenty to satiate your yearnings to keep memories of visiting ISKON at Bangalore.

Timings:
Monday through Friday
4:15am - 5:00am
7:15am - 1:00pm & 4:15 - 8:20pm

A place in Bangalore where you will get recharged/ Refreshed after your hectic work schedule. A calm & holy environment which will refresh your mind and sole for sure.,1
"It's a must visit place if you are in Bangalore . It gives a sense of satisfaction when in you are in main sanctum of the temple .But wait , the moment you start leaving the main temple to go out you have to go through numerous different types of stall which are basically rented out to sale food, clothes , books and what not and that gives a feeling of shopping complete rather than a temple and all this inside the temple premises",1
"ISKON Temple is a beautiful place of worship, and well worth the trip. Visitors should be aware that shorts are not allowed, and ladies must have their shoulders covered.
A beautiful glimpse into Hindu culture.",0
##Hey Guys if you want to spend little peaceful time in ur busy life thn come here and devote some time. Great atmosphere fresh air feel the great Krishna and make ur life blissful and happy. Thank you. Jai shree Krishna.,1
Big Krishna temple. Usually crowded. The prasad is great and lot of eating options in the temple. Very commercialized but nice for a visit,1
"Yes the place is tagged to be spiritual like a temple but too much commercial spin-ups inside waiting for your money to change hands on eatables, offerings, special entries, VIP offerings based on your financial status.",1
Jai shri krishna. Wow what a great DARSHAN. Feeling that bhagwan standing before us. Radha krishna idol great. Feeling spiritual going there and want to go there more and more. Every Hindu should go there,1
"The Temple is quite nice and very relaxing, It just gives you a good feeling and the architecture is really good.",1
ISCKON temple is located in the rajaji nagar is one of the biggest ISCKON temple iin the world. It's a part of the charitable society with the objective of propagating krishna consciousness. This temple has got fixed timings for visit and it's closed from 1pm to 4pm. There is free distribution of prasadam during the visiting hours. It's reachable by road and metro. It's a must visit location in bangalore.,1
I have been there twice. One time with friend and second time with family. Atmosphere is good but only thing I did not like that they forcefully send us through the way for exit where lots of stalls are there. It gives the feeling to have visited in a mall instead of a temple.,1
"This temple, like any other ISKCON temple, is beautiful. Queues are minimum but gets little crowded during weekends. Prasad is awesome. One starts chanting ""Hare Krishna Hare Rama' as soon as one gets inside.",1
It's a krishna consciousness temple. Very beautiful from inside and outside too. Visit it at least once.,1
Iskcon temple is a living of Lord Shree Krishna. It is the most important place to visit in bangalore. And it have an facility of Metro ‚ìÇ in bangalore.,1
"Great view of Bangalore city from this hill. Environment in the temple makes your senses quiet and calm. Chanting ""hare rama..."" for 108 times on the steps is a great experience. don't miss it. Idols of gods are decorated in a pleasing manner. Your eyes get satisfied. Allot at least 2-3 hours of time , if you are visiting for first time. You can buy prasadam (food) in the temple , many many varieties are available. It is not a problem even if you visit with small kids. ISKON has done their part very well to benefit busy citizens of Bangalore. It is your turn to make use of it.",1
You can visit this place to unwind and spent some time in divine atmosphere. They also provide pure veg bhog/meals on payment basis.,1
"This temple is a very special one and a must visit in your list. Once you are inside, you will really feel the inner peace and surrounding atmosphere is very elegant. Nice spiritual shopping you can down in side the temple premises and have some good collection. Visit in the evening will be more appealing.",1
"Awesome place ... one can get peace of mind here. I have visited twice.... Not as big as ISKON Mayapur W.B...
But I recommend this place to visit at least once. Neat & clean.. well maintained ... It's near to Yeshwanthpur Railway Station.... It's well connected from every part of Bangalore. ... one can buy books also from the counter .. like Bhagwat Geeta & other books on Sri Krishna, Mahaprabhu Chaitanya. .... A must see place for Sri Krishna & Mahaprabhu's devotees. ... Highly recommended",1

"One of the best coolest temple in Bangalore, I visited lots of time here. Beautiful view you can see from the top of temple, very silent and clean Lord Krishna temple.we can get free Prasad in temple. You can get fresh air in this temple.",1
One of the biggest Iskcon Temple in the world. Have been there to attend a wedding of my friend. Very vast landscape and beautifully managed. We stayed there at night. arrangements made by Temple authorities was good and remarkable,1
"One of the best attraction of Bangalore. Divine and Calm place. A must visit during your trip to Bangalore. After the Darshan, you reach to a restaurant which serves delicious snacks like Samosa, Kachodi, Dhokla, Pastries, Chats etc.",1
"I'm not an overtly religious person, and I have my own interpretation of what it means to be religious. Hence it isnt fair for me to review this temple as a religious place. What i can vouch for is that you will feel some positive vibes from the place. Lastly I leave you with an interesting tidbit: The Parappana Agrahara prison in Bangalore is crowded with 4700 inmates, more than twice its capacity, because small-time criminals are refusing to apply for bail, according to the Bangalore Mirror. That's because ISKCON Temple supplies food to the prison. If that isn't enough to make you want to visit, I don't know what is!",1
"It is a religious place, clean and well maintained. It is very crowded on weekends and public holidays.",1
"I can say it's a blessfull place & my love to Radha Krishna is tomuch & endless.
We regularly visit this place for darshan & pooja.
Tirupati temple is also a bonus darshan we get.
Clean & neat place well maintained.
For prasad no words to say.
Parking is available here.
JSRK",1
"Imposing architecture. Clean and well maintained. Very helpful and courteous
people or ISKCON order. Must place to visit while in Bengaluru.
Good pure vegetarian food available in the high end restaurant in temple premises. Awesome.",1
"This place is suitable to visit with family, friends or children... Good experience. On sunday's it will be little bit of rush. But on weekdays you will get some peace. Foods available here were delicious.",1

"You must visit this temple once in your lifetime.
Amazing most beautiful temple in the world.
Go and visit this temple and enjoy.",1
"Beautiful building, peace at everywhere. Quite spot in the busy city, you can sit aside to meditate. Don't like that you can not walk freely, you have to follow a cordon all the time and you can not take photos anytime of anything you want to.",1
Nice temple with nice view.near to railway station and metro. Peaceful place to relax for mind and body.,1
"one of the best clean temples around. finely structured tour , good food , good books collection , great people to talk and guide on.",1
"Crowded on week ends, otherwise peaceful temple, place to medidate. Gives a person immense pleasure to just be there.",1
When you are bored of bangalore traffic then this would be the place where you can visit and relax your mind for few hours. I am sure you would get energized with the positive vibes in and around the temple.,1
Generally evening time is good to visit this place. The evening arti is owsome. And after that do visit the temple back side. Lots of thing u can cheak out there.,1
"We the team of 6 people visited the ISKCON, bangalore temple last week. it was a wonderful experience. It is a place of bliss.
Jai Sri Krishna üôèüôè",0
"grate place to visit ,nice location ,very high temple.grate place to worship. cleanliness are very hi fi.must visit again",1
"This is a beautiful temple in the middle of the city. I went there recently and this was my second trip in the past one year. The temple is very organized with security and keeping of footwear. You have to climb steps to reach the temple. Reach during the Aarti timings to enjoy this temple. Check out the Aarti timings of Iskon from their website. It was a nice experience we took flowers, coconut, and banana as sold by Iskon for the Deities. On return, we were given all that when we were exiting the main hall. The atmosphere was extremely soothing. A must visit if you are in Bengaluru.",1
its really good temple in a huge city like bengaluru...good religious place to get peace and must visit,1
"This temple looked more like a small mall to me than a temple. As you enter you will have to undergo severe layers of checking and after that you have to climb many stairs to reach the main temple. Once you have had the darshan you will be made to walk through all the different stalls they have which became tiresome for my aged parents. You will also be given prasad after you finally come out of the temple. The main shrine is however beautiful and you can offer pushpanjali also by paying some amount. The time we went the temple was very crowded however the management was good and we did not face much issue. Also by buying some special darshan tickets you can opt for skipping the crowd. Another thing the temple had a dress code board on display which said ladies wearing only saree, salwar or kurti would be allowed in....however we found ladies wearing jeans also going (though they were few in number).....however one girl wearing three-fourth was stopped at the entrance.",1
"i had been to Iskon temple last month along with my family. We had been to temple by evening 6.30. It was a Saturday, so the temple was very crowded. But volunteers manged the crowed very well . The place is very spacious. we need to keep our shoes near to the entrance. The ISKON has many small temples in it. once you are in front of the main temple, you can see amazing view of Bangalore. I think photography is prohibited in the temple premises. When you enter the bhajan hall, you will get a amazing feel. all will be in prayers. Securities will push you before you pay or see lord krishna. I could see the people who came in 100 rupees pass, the priests treating then royally, for others securities treated like slaves. The temple has big canteen, they provide 3 time free food. Also they has big bakery inside the temple, so you can buy sweets from there. The best time to visit the temple is morning 5-30 to 7.30",1
"Visited this temple on a Sunday evening.
It is crowded but very systematic and peaceful . Very good vibes and have very good prasadam also. If someone is looking for good bhajans and peaceful Darshan....this is the place to visit.",1
"One of the biggest ISKON temples. Systems for darshan queue are very good and hassle free. They do not allow shorts for men but dhotis are available at luggage counter. Food mall after darshan exit is huge. Has very tasty and hygienic food options. Best time to visit would be after sunset, as climate and views become very good.",1
Please be careful of the dress code. Shorts are not allowed. You can get dhoti on rent which can be wore on top of shorts. Similar to any other ISKCON temple in India. I liked ISKCON MAYAPUR(west Bengal) or the one in Delhi more.Still good place to visit.,0
"You would feel religious at time of entry if you had visited ISKON before, however the whole experience is a facade with a lot of shopping articles and food court.",1
"ISKCON has two temples in Bangalore, of which the one at Hare Krishna Hill in Rajajinagar is the more popular one. A large complex built in the Dravidian style, this temple sees a heavy rush from devotees particularly on weekends and during festivals, hence, one needs to plan to spend time before going.

The temple has beautiful fountains and carvings. The idols are all well-crafted (refer to the pics of the same on their website). There are also food stalls, book stores and stalls for devotional items, as common with other ISKCON temples. The prasadam is extremely tasty and hygienic.

The temple is kept clean by the volunteers. One needs to deposit one's bag etc. before entering. Parking can be an issue during peak hours, but considering the place is a short walk from the nearby metro station and Yeshwantpur bus and railway stations, getting here is not much of an issue.",1
"I have only sentence: If there's a Heaven on Earth, it's here, it's here, it's here. Come visit this exquisite Temple of the Lord Krishna and Experience it to understand what I've said.",1
"It's one of the major tourist attraction in Bengaluru. Very Beautiful temple and well managed.
Though it might get crowded in evenings on weekends but on weekdays,its mostly peaceful.",1
Located in very busy area in Bangalore but still it attracts tourist at this temple. You can surely meditate and relax your mind after having hectic day in bangalore traffic.,1
this temple is very famous and we like to spend some time with family when we come to bangalore on trip,1
"The darshan was good, the krishna idol is awesome and the temple was cleanly maintained.
But this is all until the main temple inside. Once you are done with the darshan, then enter the prasad/food junction, which is really crowded, and not well maintained. No management to handle the crowd there, people just rush through the food counters and the food is scrambled on floor, not cleaned etc. You'll lose the essence that you are in a temple that time. The parking is a big headache again, where in you have to walk to the other end of the temple after darshan, which is painful for elders. Lots of improvements required, and there is no feedback collection as well to suggest.",1
Very Beautiful Temple. I visited with my family in Feburary. The experience was mesmerising to say the least.,1
"This temple is of lord Krishna is good to see on Krishna janmasthami, lot of devotees r there to see god",1
"Really got afraid while exiting temple because of weak wooden steps of flyover exit. I am afraid if not taken care , accident may happen.",1
"Located in a traffic congested area in Bengaluru. The inside is so different & peaceful.
Probably a long winded queue to reach the inner sanctum, depending upon the day of the week/public holiday/festival etc. Well worth the wait & effort. Try to make it to the aarati & bhajan.
Hare Raama Hare Raama
Raama Raama Hare Hare
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
This chant reverberates in our ears for good. Devotion is expressed via song & dance. Prasad is given after the aarti. A good restaurant & cafeteria are at the premises. Has a large interesting shop for varied memorabilia. An auditorium for events exists too. Limited parking for vehicles. Washrooms are wet but usable in case of urgent need. Drinking water from coolers is freely available.
A guest house for members to stay is available. Prasad is also served as lunch/dinner on purchase of coupons of nominal cost.

Carry your own water bottle (if allowed).
Dont wear your best footwear (tho it is well taken care of unless you misplace your coupon).
Check for public holiday/festival prior to going. Especially if you need to park your vehicle.
Participate in the arati & bhajan.",1
"The temple has a welcoming feel to it. The gold plated interior was attractive too. The queue to get in though..... except you pay extra to jump the Q.

No photos allowed in the temple. No shorts allowed. No sleeveless shirts allowed.",1
"Iskcon Temple Bangalore: 108 steps of chanting Hare Krishna Hare Rama is a very unique experience especially after 26 hours flight, 3.5 hour sleep, and 8 hours work meeting! Krishna Krishna Hare Hare ... it gives me energy!

We went there in the evening. no shoes allowed, even not allowed in your purse. Of course, no photo either. Prepare to leave your shoes in the car. Cell phone is allowed.

The chanting and service singing are amazing... worth the time.",1
Better place to get peace of mind. Better place to get peace of mind. Better place to get peace of mind.,1
"I went with my wife on Sunday afternoon... kindly note the temple opens from morning till night on weekends and on holiday. Place is kept very clean..
There was continuous stream of devotees..they have a provision for special darshan..Rs.300/- per family ..max 6 people. This entitles one to bypass line, go very close and provision to sit in front of narasimhaswamy idol and venkateshwara temple.

Food- lot of option in food court on your way out from main shrine at affordable rate..one hotel offered buffet south Indian at Rs.180/-.

"This temple is located atop a hillock with a great view
spread over a vast area . The beauty of temple will is Truly moving . The cleanliness , and the arrangements here are impeccable - considering the large number of people coming here . It may take more then 30/40
Minutes to reach the main shrine . There several smaller shrines all along
The way before you main hall of shrine . It breath takingly beautiful ! The devotees are moved by just being here . There is free Prasad at the exit . There is also an eatery selling eatable if you wish eat / carry home . Many shops of books and nick knacks . Ample parking but tends to get crowded over the weekend . A great attraction of must visit list of this city .!",1
"Chants of krinsha with peaceful aura comes in every moment u spend in temple. In temple u can buy quality snacks.
Try coconut barfi.",1
"This should b first in everyone itinerary . Too much organised related to the movement of people. Very peaceful ,pious and serene place.",1
Awesome place. What a experience this was. Huge temple of Lord Radhekrishna.This temple is one of the largest ISKCON TEMPLE of India.,1
"Lord Krisna is being worshipped daily more than50,000 people from India and foreign devotees. The temple is maintained neatly. They chant , including the daily visitors ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" throughout day. The dedicated Krishna followers are helping the visitors with kind and affection. It is one of the must visiting place at Bangalore. Do not miss to see and get Krishna's blessings.",0
Temple is nice to visit. There is a room for improvement for orderly allowing the visitors. Marketing to be done in a separate place and It should not be forced / make compulsory the devotees / visitors to sail through the marketing place. Temple building should be used exclusively for devotional purposes.,1
"Divine and Discipline.Situated an small hill. Beautiful view with great atmosphere.Best management with good food.
#Hare krishna, krishna krishna hare hare chants. Positive energy allover.",1
It's really nice temple of Radha Krishna... beautiful architecture work done... well maintained and everything is well organized.... feel so good... transport facility up to main gate,1
"The place is so spiritual. Once you enter you can feel it. I went with my dad and bro. We had a nice experience. For person coming to Bangalore first time, it is a must go place.",1
"Well build and managed very well. Temple takes cleanliness as very seriously. This is place, where peace thrives. One can get lots of books on Krishna and Vedas,",1
"We visited the temple on a rainy evening. What stands out first is the nearly organised car parking.

The entire temple complex is a series of vegetarian food shops on the ground floor...Ranging from over the counter snack shops to exorbitantly priced fine dining.

Start climbing the stairs and you will be impressed with the semi modern architecture. Also the queues are efficiently organised and within 15 minutes you are in the main hall.

The main hall is grand. A huge capola with frescos from the life of Krishna will keep you mesmerised till you reach the main shrine.

For Rs. 150 per family you can break off from the regular line and get a family Darshan right in front of the deity.

The way back winds through a series of outsourced counters where vendors try and sell you just about anything with branding of Krishna on the goods.

That kills the euphoria and spirituality you felt a few moments back.

TIP : The samosas stall on the way out has a good fare.",1
"I visited the place with my family. For few moments, I feel that I am in a completely different world. I love the Krishna bhajan, divinity of the place. I also enjoyed the food sold as prasad there.",0
Me and my family had visited Iskcon last month. It had really been a great devotional experience. The entire compound is so well maintained and the main temple's vibration and all Diety's idol is beyond words. Amazing...,1
"Mostly about lord Krishna. Temple is modern and awesome.
take the free prasada than the paid one. It tastes well.",1
"You can reach temple by Metro train or bus or by auto from Bangalore. Eassily accessible. Temple is on hill, hence need to climb if on walk. Or else auto /car can drop at entrace in side temple. Take 300 rs ticket for entire family.
Puja of god takes 10-15 minutes.
Have stumptous food in canteen before prasad,.
Wide variety of foods availble. Food will be enjoyed by kids.",0
"You can feel the peace as soon as you enter into the temple, its a good place for presence of mind. but iskcon is a commercial place with lots of shops.",1
it was my wedding anniversary and i visited this temple for the first time. We were in time for the aarti and it was a wonderfully divine feeling. The 108 steps you pass while chanting at each step was a moving feeling. A place you feel where God actually resides. a very well organised institute. A place you can't miss if you are in bengaluru.,1
"A wonderful temple that is worth the visit and within my short visit to Bengaluru for 2 days, I managed to visit this temple twice just to view the day and night view of this temple (photo as attached) ...A million thanks to the temple management who is managing the temple well... I felt so peaceful and at serene while meditating in this temple... Every deity looking very divide and beautiful... This is definitely a must visit place while in Bangalore... (Note: no photography is allowed inside the temple premises)",0
This is all time favorite place in Bangalore. A must visit place in Bangalore which i recommend everyone to go,1
"It is very good Krishna temple in bengaluru, It has very nice art work in the temple and has nice restaurant where you can have very delicious food items.",1
The temple is well cleaned and maintained and situated will within city and accessible all the time from every corner of the city.It is worth visiting and one can rejoice there spiritually.,1
"It's difficult to drive and reach there and find parking but once you reach it's great feeling. You meditate and feel fresh.
Temple is situated high for great view once you reach there.
Food in Temple is very simple but superb!!

"Nice temple to visit in the evening, preferably on weekdays or non festival days.Nice restaurants are inside the complex, reasonably priced.
As is common in any public place,the restrooms needs better attention for maintenance.",1
one of the most beautifully maintained with excellent ambience for all lord krishna devotees. it also has guest house at reasonable cost and lovely food - a low cost restaurent and a mid level cuisine - both are very good.,1
"Very nice place to visit. Calm ambience, clean quiet religious place. It is about 4-5 kms from Majestic/ City Railway station and can be easily reached by auto/bus.",1
I got to visit this temple when am moving across bangalore to mysore....i found this temple to be one of the best temples that we have in the south region thus i say at a place where we get much peace and attract us towards godly path....!!!,1
"Nice place on top of hill,view from top is awesome,u can feel serenity and peace of mind on reaching there.Just sit and give time to urself.During Arati it will be crowded but worth the visit.",1
ISKCON Temple is located near yashvanpur. A nice temple with very beautiful idols of Lord Krishna & good surroundings. You are served with Prasad after the darshan. On festival days it gets pretty crowded. In all a must visit place when you are in Bangalore.,1
"So many things to do at ISKCON. Pray, meditate, sing, participate in chanting, great food corner, books and other interesting gift ideas. The idols just speak to you !! A must visit place if you are in Bangalore !",1
"lovely temple. wonderful vibes. go to pray or just go to see the grandeur. you can get a lot of souvenirs, books. Great food too. they have lifts for senior citizens too. but will have to climb a couple of steps here and there.",0
"Its always a good idea to visit this place at least once if you are planning to visit Bangalore. Its huge and architecturally a great structure, well planned and executed.

Old people with knee problems should give it a miss as the number of steps are too many but that is purely due to the hilly nature and crowd management.

Everything is systematic, right from depositing your shoes, hand wash and crowd management is awesome till the main temple area.(Though I didn't like the chanting on each step).

Once the darshan is completed, now starts the real fun, chaos and mis-management. The temple suddenly turns into a food court, shopping mall, selling you t-shirts, paintings, souvenirs and snacks. Sometimes you find people loitering on the floors making it difficult for you to walk and food crumbles attracting flies and ants. A complete mis-management here.

Its always a tourist attraction and yes I have visited the place more than a couple of times just due to the demand from different family members and my attraction are the snacks and sweets served there.",1
"It is nicely maintained. Lot of volunteers are involved in maintaining cleanliness. It is having serene atmosphere. Water pond, lot of greenery, lot of flower pots. Drinking water is always made available. Wash rooms are well maintained. Even physically challenged persons can visit. Wheel chairs are available. Personal cars can go to the top spot.

"its a must for all family who visits bangalore as it not only gives you fanatic and charismatic views but also give one a very bless full, spiritual peace of mind.a",1
Its holy temple. Very peaceful place for worshiping lord krishna. Avoid weekends as the place will be crowded.,1
Its good to visit the temple once and go in general que with mantra jaap of 108 times. Sometimes gives you a feel of shopping malls . Atmosphere is really very peacefull and calm.,1
"My friend from the UK and I visited this marvellous temple ( it was one of the attractions - a must visit in his itinerary) earlier this month. He was so impressed with whatever he saw! He was just bowled over!! The Prasadam - he couldn't enjoy as it slipped out of his hand as he couldn't eat with hands!! No spoons!! He was not complaining!! We didn't find any easy exit- we had to go through the entire length of the pathway! Or was there
Any easy exist, we wouldn't know! All in all it's a wonderful experience!",1
"Very refreshing & blissful experience at the entrance itself!

Very clean and tidy temple which is rare in India.

Laddoo Prasad is awesome! Good collection of books at the temple stores.

More than satisfying experience! Must See place in Bengaluru!!",1
"The temple looks good along with the arrangements and all the architecture stuff. But it's not a typical temple concept what we see in other places.. After you visit the place, you will feel like you went to a museum rather than a temple. A lot of money has been spent on the architecture and decorations.
Still a good place to visit for once to get an experience of how things go around in temples like these.",1
I went on a Sunday and there was quite some crowd and the queue system was well organised..remember to wear full length pants or you will have to rent dhotis...the temple is well maintained..,0
"One of the best Iskcon temples in the world. Spacious and situated on top of a hill, it has a very calm and serene atmosphere.

"The lord Sri Krishna and Balarama inside the temple was so eye feasting..!!
The prasadam was so delicious..!!
Food court was amazing in the temple..!!",1
"Its the only isckon temple in blr, around at rajaji ngr. Best way to visit all the famous places in blr is to buy blr darshini ticket (its a hop on hop off bus service) which offers an entire day travel, plus has a guide who tells u more on history & stories related to all these places & its a cheaper & convenient option as a lot ot places within blr are quite far off distance & traffic is a buzz kill too. I used to visit isckon temple mainly over the my free weekends when i wanted some peace & tranquillity from everyone & everything around me.",1
"I often, visit Iskcon temple. Temple is divine beautiful, Calm your mind with Hare Krishna Chant in the background. Temple is very neat and Clean. You will get the blessing of Lord Narasimha, Lord Balaji and Finally Lord Krishna (main temple). No words to express beauty of God. One should not miss this place. While exiting, you will find book stores, few youth programs and get to see film theatre they play movie related Krishna story/life cycle story. Once you cross theatre, you will find temple related materials, food items. Once you exit from the venue, they issue Prasadam(Pongal) it will taste yummy. just love Isckon Prasadam. Photography is not allowed inside temple. However, you can take photo once you exit from main venue.",1
"I am not much of a religious type , but I have gone there for the view , Kesari bath and Baigan (egg plant ) pakori. According to me they make the best kesari bath in bangalore.",1
"Very Nice place to Calm your mind.
Inside there is continue Prayer is going on.
Systematic approach to the main temple with proper queue.
Every person has been provided with ""Bhog"".
Photography Prohibited.",1
Nice place to visit in the early morning & evening. The view from top is excellent during night. The temple is very neat & clean. Good parkin place for vehicles at the top and has easy access. Best time to visit is during Krishna Janmastami.,1

Free food every day. A lot of shops to eat. Aarti is beautiful.",1
"It a very nice and attractive place, actually its not a place its a home of Lord Sri Krishna. Very attractive deity and very beautiful decoration of Lord by temple priest. Everyone must visit this temple. Very delicious prasadam must have before leaving the temple.

hey krishna......i heard a lot of times about you and your place really really really you amazed me such a cool looks your are so beautiful nice place even though the place is so rush and busy with many devotees you really given my calmness......,0
"Earlier there used to be peace, ample of space to sit and chant but now it has become more commercial. Missed the old ISKCON Bangalore.",1
"One of the famous temple in South India.Good to go bit early around 6 so that the heavy traffic can be avoided and a good darshan is possible.There is a huge car parking facility and also there is a place for keeping the sandals.You can either go for free darshan or paid,if paid you can go through a separate path without standing in the queue.The main temple is at the top and atmosphere is very peaceful.",1
It is lord krishna where need to see in the large no of devotees we need to be in presence of lord krishna if we are there at place it is place where only name of lord krishna listens such a pleasant,1
Like all the iskcon temple they have maintain cleanliness and peaceful environment... The devotees entry and exit are arrange very nicely... Lots of shop and exhibition centre and foods in between the premises of temple,1
"While it's religious, one can visit it for the marvelous architecture and awesome food. Avoid holidays as it gets really crowded.",1
"I went to ISKCON on a Sunday night time. It was the first timeI went to that temple. I work on the sites of the are in which the temple is located. Each time when I pass the temple, I feel an experience of seeing white divine place. Atlast, I really experienced Lord Krishna's blessings fell in me.",1
Well maintained and so clean and tidy. One thing i hate is too much of queue and lots of marketing strategies in the name of devotion. Except these 2 a good place to visit.,1
It is one of the best temples to visit in Bangalore the structure is great and management is fantastic,1
"Very big temple with pleasent atmosphere
Most important in this temple is
Krishna chanting is all over the place
It helps to relax our mind and body
And the prasadams are available in downstairs u should not miss that",1
"I recently came to Bangalore on business for two weeks, my first time ever travelling outside of the US. Some of my co-workers took me to do site-seeing over the weekend, and I asked them to show me things that represented Bangalore and the culture here. The Iskcon Temple was the first place they took me. My impression of this place is almost indescribable. It's beauty is absolutely breathtaking, and that's not even touching on the overwhelming feeling of peace when you're inside. By far, my favorite place of everywhere that I went in Bangalore. An experience you don't want to miss.",1
"Really a pleasent feeling after visiting this place ,loved this place both devotional and entertainment place
Hare krishna.........",1
Good place to find mind peace and family outings.there you can find restaurants sweet shop and many more.you have to know that timings 12pm to 4pm this temple will remain close,1
We have so proud to be said am Hindu . Because of our gods are all wondering in the world . Last month my family members with me also went iskcon temple we have lots enjoying in moment . It is in near yashwanthapur railway station.,1
"The attractive architecture and fascinating surrounding in the lap of bengaluru

One of the landmark in Bangalore worth visiting ...very well organised and one place which is contribute to society with their annadan and midday meal programmes.,1
"Parking:- Car and Bike parking is available
Temple : Inside - view of god is amazing with gold every where
: Outside - its a very big temple and u will find positive vibes

commercial shops :- once u wanted to come out of temple u fell that the way u have to follow is a way to all commercial shops which if u want to avoid cannot and this it doesnot give me a felling of visiting temple its like a mall
else if u like to shop and eat food u will enjoy.
with such a huge temple there will not be a space to sit and meditate u just have to follow the queue and walk....",1
A more modern temple which is very much worth a visit. Men must wear long trousers and women also need to have their legs covered.,0
The temple is so nice and clean and looks too rich. Only temple that I've seen in my life with such a silent and divine place.,1
One the must visit place in Bangalore for the spiritual persons. You will find a lot of commercial shops inside the temple.,1
We have visited the temple during the time of sunset. They lights of the temple were turning on. We enjoyed the whole lighting including the sunsets from the hill of the temple. I also suggest people to visit the temple during the starting of evening period.,1
Just visit for the temple and do not get attracted by the commercialisation they do. Temple is very good.,1
"Really good ceremony inside and you can see, on the way to the interior of the temple, several Hindi Gods. Very interesting to experience how different that culture, than the european culture. The entry price is cheap. Before you go inside, you have to take off your shoes and let by the entry you bags.",1
"Hare Rama,hare rama rama rama hare hare!
The chantings are so soothing and you never know when you start chanting with the voice over the speaker.
Waiting in line for the Lord's gkimpse is not so difficult.We can buy the Rs 300 family coupon and proceed for the Aarthi and darshan.
The Lord Almighty takes you to another world when you sit in front of him and sing the bhajans.
The prasadam, the book coupons, the way out ,the delicacies on the way all add on to the glory of the Lord.
A very well maintained and beautiful temple.",0
"Temple is good but has become more commercial. From the checking point till the lord idol it is maintained clean, but in the commercial area it is not that clean. Parking becomes messier during weekend .",1
I visited with my family and i felt good after came back from temple. This is one of the must visited place in Bangalore.,1
"Best place to go for an evening, eyes will be filled with beauty of Special evening Aarathi.
U can catch a metro from mantri square for a quick ride, traffic free.",1
The ISKCON temple is very well maintained and it's a beautiful temple in while. The specialty here is the huge ladoo that is peculiar to the place.,1
"The serenity and beauty of this place has been marred by its commercialization....but yes, it can be visited once if you appreciate architecture. Avoid visiting on special occasions because the crowd gets too suffocating.",1
"Divine place to be visited by everyone... Cleanly maintained premises with all facilities available. If there is a rush due to an occasion/special day, go for direct darshan which cost Rs 250/- for a family of 6 members.",1
"While entering this temple, you will feel a different kind of energy all together and you will realise that you have come to a place where you can forget all the tensions and just live with a free mind for sometime. Its an attraction from the architectural point of view too, and quite centrally located. A must visit place if you have any plans to visit a temple in Bengaluru.",1
"Traveled to this temple a week back. From sarjapur road it took me 1.30 hours to reach in car, not sure about other modes of transport. The temple has adequate parking so it was very comfortable.
It was a rush time, so took a special darshan pass, this is for 6 people @ 300.
Their are 3 temples, no need to mention it was a divine experience. :)",1
The temple is one of the most adorable one. The structure are nice and very beautiful temple. Its colourful and very friendly people around helping to show the temple.,1
"We visited the temple late afternoon while still daylight but by the time we came out of the temple it was dark. So glad we saw it both in daylight and whilst lit up it was a magnificent sight. Everyone was really helpful and guided us. It was breathtaking and we are so glad we chose to visit this particular temple.
On the way out there are many items for sale which are all very reasonably priced (very cheap in fact).",0
Best place to visit in Bangalore if you the fan of lord Krishna. this place has very good calmness about it.,1
"Nice and clean Holy place , a temple of lord krishna managed very well by ISKON group .Ideal place for getting peace of mind amidst the bengaluru town",1
"Beautiful structural design with unique culture. Prior to going inside the temple, leave your footwear at designated areas. Don't forget to get your number to claim your footwear later. Here are some tips to make the visit convenient and memorable: 1. Wear proper attire like pants or long skirts, 2. Find the visitor area and pay the necessary fees to avoid long queue, 3. Spend some time looking at the main area where people worship through dance, 4. Bring some cash to buy religious, toys, food, souvenir items inside the temple.",1
"This ISKCON Temple is very well located on top of a hill and offers a great view of the surroundings . It is splendidly built in white marble and always kept spic and span . Except for festival days enables the visitor to get a darshan of the deities , reasonably fast . Anyway the queue for the darshan is well organised . There are good eating possibilities within the complex as well as a luxury vegetarian food restaurant High on Taste offering sattvic delicacies.",1
Beautiful place. Easy flow of queues. Serene and tranquil. A must visit when in Bangalore. The prayer group softly chanted and the public could join in. Amazing paintings on the ceiling of the temple. Devotional literature can be purchased from the prayer goods shop at the temple. No entrance fee,1
"I visited this place with my family in winter vacation last year. Temple management is really good in all aspects; starting from footwear and baggage counter to Darshan queue. They have visitors from all over the world coming throughout the year. After Darshan, we had delicious prasadam. I think prasadam is highlight of the visit not only for kids but for adults too.",1
a very clean temple. nice feel. not like other temples this temple has its own charm. don't visit on janamastmi if you dont like crowded place. but its worth once.,1
"This is a definite not to be missed place in Bangalore. The temple is not only well maintained but also well organised. Also you wont have any problems of any sort of request for offerings from the priests. They are well prepared if there is a rush. There is a big space allocated for keeping shoes and belongings. However if girls are going sleeveless then they will have to purchase/rent a shawl type stole, since the dress code is strict. Once you are inside the temple, taking of photographs is prohibited. Before entering the main temple of Krishna, you will be visiting the smaller temples of Shri Narasimha and Shri Venkatesh. Before entering the main temple, do look around from the top since the view is splendid (if you during a festival you might see fireworks which are awesome). The view is comparable to that of Birla Mandir in Hyderabad. Inside the temple there is a big hall with very nice paintings/carvings on the roof. The main temple has three chambers of deities. Everything is well managed and the Darshan is in a linear fashion. After the darshan in a line, you can sit in the specified place in front of the main chambers. Thereafter you will be going out the exit with various stalls of religious books and the volunteers will enlighten you on their programs if you are interested to go forward with it. After the exit downwards, you will get various shops of things to buy or eat. Thereafter before going to the fountain area you will get Prasadam. You can take a few pics in the fountain area wherefrom the main temple is in view. After wards you can exit and at the exit there is a restaurant if you would like to eat.

Bonus tip : One of the best malls of Bangalore is also nearby - Orion Mall - It has got everything in a mall (even Starbucks) and at the backside is a small artificial lake and amphi theatre, sometimes musical fountain with lights is also there. There is BluO also, if you're into bowling.",1
"This is indeed a very special place, and it is more inspiring and more spectacular with each visit. I came here in the early days and what has not changes is the cleanliness, the attention to detail and the sheer intensity of prayer and devotion",0
"I visited the ISKCON temple today. My understanding is that you can only visit while the prayer sessions are in progress. Of course this makes it all the more interesting! I am a Western woman, and wore long floaty pants/trousers and a large scarf wrapped around my upper half. I was assisted at every step of the way by very friendly people working at the temple who helped with ticket purchase, explaining where I was to go and what to do at each step. I was made to feel very welcome and special even. There were hundreds of devotees there as well and the experience was very interesting and humbling as the people were clearly very devout and focussed on their prayer. A great place to visit but make sure you check the prayer times in advance (on the gate and on their website) and are dressed appropriately or you will not be able to enter. (Shoulders and legs covered.).",1
"I would say its more of a Tourist spot then a Temple ,Very discplined and clean .beautiful Moortis of Gods.Lot of books available for improving your spiritual knowledge
Also a good restaurent veg and items made of pure ghee
There are also counters for sales of items like Rudraksh ,photos teeshirts etc",1
"Though its temple, I could see lot of people visit as a sight seeing. Nice place. A good built in peaceful atmosphere.",1
"Must visit to see the architecture of the building. Please visit over weekdays, weekend it's too crowded, do try the laddoos.",0
"Usually in Bangalore every place is crowded on a Weekend and so was the Temple.Its busy with a queue to the main abode that could take anywhere from 30 - 60 mins. On a Sunny day this could be a tad tiring. To start with, they have a very good arrangement of securing your slippers in. You can also opt for a locker where you can secure your valuables though i prefer not to carry any except a mobile phone (which is almost a body part these days) which also needs to be secured in a locker. You have to climb some steps to reach the top of the hill, where main abode, the hall for Krishna temple, Bhajans and meditation are all there. The first feeling is like a WOW!!! You can feel the bliss and the energy of all like minded people doing one thing - Praying and some trying to connect to inner self.
Few things you will notice here are the cleanliness, greenery are outstanding. I think they truly believe cleanliness is next to godliness.
Dont forget to collect the Prasadams on your way out. There are few shops on your way out, which sell a lot of literature about Lord Krishna and more. A few more shops for other religious and fancy purchases.

A Very Godly Service they provide is through the Akshayapatra Foundation - I have been myself part of some Akshayapatra Service through CSR in my company and cant tell you how Fulfilling it is to see the free mid-day meal service being served to deserving kids across India. You can be a part of it once you enquire there.

Overall, Excellent and Truly blissful experience.",1
Very nice temple of Lord Vishnu...Lot of peace inside temple... Atmosphere is very graceful..I felt lot of peace in my mind.,1
It takes immense pride in letting know all regular visitors that I was involved in the initial surveying work of this Iconic structure way back in 1988 & this happened to be my first assignment of my career. This is a must to see place whoever visits Bangalore. The Akshaya Patra started by this organization is a grand success in the field of feeding hot food to all children studying in Government Schools. The restaurant at the temple complex serves delicacies which are mouth watering.,1
"This is one of the best and sacred Krishna temple's in town. The place is more like a tourist spot apart from being a temple. Entire temple has been build very well and it looks quite clean & polished. Temple is a great spectacle to watch during the evening, when the lights are lit up.
This is must visit place when a traveler comes to Bangalore. There is another ISKCON Gho-Shala near Kamanahalli, which is not the same as this.
At the end of drashan, every devotee is given 'Prasaad' which is quite good.
Plan to spend nearly 2-3hrs when you go there.",1
It is most beautiful temple in Bangalore. Architecture also very nice. A nice temple to visit on weekend with family. Prasad also very tasty.,1
"It's a big and equally beautiful place, lots and lots of greenery, beautiful gardens and of course the lord ideals are simply superb. Good place to spend about an hour unless you are a very spiritual person.",1
"The temple is good place to spend a peaceful evening. It is well managed, clean and the also offer food at certain times of the day.",1
this is a awesome place in bengaluru. more over the top location this very nice and out-side seen around the tampel is nice.,1
"We visited this temple.You have to climb some steps to reach in temple. Camera and mobile are not allowed inside temple. This is a glorious temple of Krishna,Balram and Subhadra in Bangalore.This is #1 hindu religious tourist place in Banglore, DO visit.",1
"This place is really beautiful, must visit this place. You can shop here too. I loved the Laddus from there.",1
"This temple is in Rajajinagar, close to the city centre. It is an extremely beautiful and well-maintained temple, located on a hillock and is best visited during the cooler months of the year, either early in the morning or just before sunset for good views. I am not sure if there is a formal dress code notice. But being a place of worship, it is best to be in decent attire. I went there during non-peak hours. It also wasn't during the festive season, so it was not very crowded. Quite a bit of walk is involved as the temple complex is quite huge. The Hare Krishna chanting in the temple is pleasant. Food (like eggless cakes, savouries and sweets) is awesome inside the complex and is sold at very reasonable rates (other than the 'prasadam' which is of course offered free to all devotees). Besides there are quite a few shops selling art work and crafts (like Tanjore paintings, religious idols, incense sticks, sandalwood scented items, souvenirs). The whole experience is soothing and surely worth a visit.",1
I love this temple . Its so peaceful here . My family get very good after visit of this temple . you need to come here atleast once!!,1
This place is simply beautiful..Don't assume just temple..it is fully commercial..you will get shopping..food..side seeing..must see.,0
"The ISKCON temple is beautiful and again a must visit. Spread over a vast area there is ample parking space and is quite well organised. The evening prayer and aarthi gives a sense of peace and is calming. There is also a community kitchen/ restaurant (not a restaurant in the real sense of the word) which serves various snacks and delicious typically South Indian delicacies. Everything is served in the name of ""Prasad''. A different and unique experience.",1
Always nice to be able to retreat in a constantly busy city. The enormous amount of work which has been done to create this huge complex. Then also...the food/snacks is/are just divine!,1
I never feel at peace in this place. They look like manage grads in saffron atire running business in the name of charity. They have good parking.,0
"Every time I visit the temple there is a fresh feeling. Continuous bhajans, nama smaran, good Prasad, lot of books to buy. For kids there are some movie shows about Krishna. There are some summer classes also for kids.
Next to the temple (within the campus) there is a veg restaurant with delicious food.",1
"Visited June 2016.Our good Indian friend took us to visit Iskon. One funny thing he forgot to mention though was that we had to walk barefoot from the parking lot, all the way to the temple. We didn't mind it though. A tip, leave your shoes in your car instead of leaving it in the repository as there are too many visitors and you risk losing your shoes or getting them mixed up, alternately you can stuff your shoes in your bag. Bring some wet ones to wipe off your dusty feet after the visit.
The temple was majestic. Intricately designed all over. Going up the main staircase gave us a view of the lower parts of the temple, the roofs stunningly encased in gold!
Inside the temple, we got to sit in the middle of a group of meditating and chanting visitors. Truly gave us a positive vibe.
As we exited the place, we were led to a small bakeshop where all authentic Indian sweets and pastries were sold at cheap prices. We also liked the souvenir shop with the quaint books and trinkets.",1
"Beautiful temple for Lord Krishna, we visited the temple with friends on the birthday of Rama. Seen a huge celebration. A place for meditation, devotion, prayers.",1
Very nice temple you need to walk through steps as this is on high elevation. Overcrowded on holidays and festivals. tIt is great till you reach the temple but while coming out they have commercialised the place to the core with shops and food stalls.,1
Really amazing spiritual place. A good place to feel the spirituality and the peace over there. You can enjoy the bhajans and feel the belief in the god.,0
We're not followers of Hare Krishna but appreciated the fervor of those who do follow at this lovely temple.,0
√Ä temple like no other one. Incredible contrast between entrance via temple and exit via √† long series of shops.,0
This place is the ultimate stress reliever. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare...maha mantra relieves stress and infuse positivism.,1
Wonderful place for those who love to visit temples. You need to walk through steps. Over crowded on Sundays and other holidays.,1
"Visiting this Temple allowed us to think about our own beliefs and what it means to believe. We were impressed by its efficiency... ticket, shoes, borrowing dhotis (heads up, it has dressing rules- no exposed knees or legs. We had to deposit 1000 rupees to borrow their dhotis), and admiring several temples as we climbed up. It concluded with many gift shops, concession stands, and book shops. Lots of people were there as is not uncommon wherever you go in India. In sum, the whole experience was different and it was in some way exhilarating. I would recommend checking it out if you are interested in knowing more about Hinduism and what they do there- a total cultural experience with a hint of tourism.",1
This place is good to see and chanting is awesome ... Wonderful place to visit those who love to visit temples,0
"Well the title says it all. This place is well barricaded, well maintained by the sevaks/security personnel who in turn guide the devotees to the main temple. Though it feels a little frustrating as you have to walk a long way up to the main temple but as you reach the main temple mere darshan of holy god takes away all your tiredness.
I did not liked the way ISKCON is marketing Krishna but it's my personal view. This place is good for people who are able to walk properly and balance themselves as there's a lot of push n pull due to huge crowd gatherings. The free prasadam counter is at a very narrow corner. The temple trustee may rethink of moving it. I have visited the temple more than couple of times but will advise people/bhakts to avoid Sunday's or any special holy day since its overcrowded and it leads to fracas between the temple securities/sevaks who maintain the huge queues and even at the pvt. car entrance.
For aged people although they have offered wheel chair service but it will be good if they provide sevaks to push the wheel chairs as well.
Overall the experience of visiting this place is heavenly as you enter the garbha gruha or main temple you forget all your complaints,that's the beauty of god.
So just a word of advice try avoid this place on overcrowded days and don't take aged people along with you who can't walk properly.

The views are entirely personal not meant to be hurt anyone.

Jai shree krishna!!!",1
"Compared to the ISCON in bhubaneswar, its much better, bigger, and has a magnificent architecture. If u want to spent some time with the presence of lord krishna in its vibe...THEN IT IS THE PERFECT PLACE!!!

Just one complaint that the commitee people have started a buisness in the sake of god there as well as in bbsr which is quiet depressing!!!",1
"Beautiful temple, located in Yesvantpur, around 8 km from Railway Station. Amazing place for spiritual unwinding. One can have wonderful Darshan of
Lord Krishna here. Temple is maintained well and is very neat and clean. Quality of food offered as prasadam (Annadana) is too good.

From other reviews, to get more clarity :
1. No body here forcing us to chant:
‚ÄúHare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama
Rama Rama Hare Hare‚Äù

2. Also there is no Entrance fee.

3. Temple timings:
Monday to Friday: 4.15 am to 5.00 am, 7.00 am to 1.00 pm, 4.00 pm to 8.20 pm
Saturday, Sunday & Public Holiday : 4.15 am to 5.00 am, 7.00 am to 8.30 pm",1
"The Iskcon temple situated in Yesvantpur is a very good place to visit to seek the blessings of Lord Krishna. The journey to the temple from our home was however very long and time consuming in the traffics of Bangalore. But upon reaching the temple you would definitely be taken aback by its beauty and cleanliness. Everything is so organised in this temple right from the pathway, the stands for our footwears and the food and purchase stalls which comes after we have worshipped the lord Krishna. The main shrine is adorned with such beautiful ornaments and clothing making the entire scene a treat for our eyes. Also the repeated chants of Hard Krishna ... Hare Krishna... Krishna Krishna Hare Hare. Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama... Rama hare hare... takes our faith to a different level.
Altogether a good divine experience.",1
"regularly visit with my family for darshans and great vegetarian food with variety of options,especially at the higher taste restaurant..",1
Om shanti!! Amazing place for spiritual unwinding. Take a drop taxi and not full day one.... There is magical power in the place that will ensure you do not go further but will be mesmerized to stay.,1
"This is located in center of the city. It is the first place to visit, if we are planing to go by Bengaluru Darashan Bus. Very good bird eye view of city can be seen from this temple as it is located on Hill area.",1
"It is one of the most sought after place in Bangalore. The premises is clean and aromatic.

People need to visit various temples before they reach to the main temple courtyard.

The carving and paintings on the wall and roof is mesmerising. The prasad is also available at the exit. Variety of items are available for sale at the outer courtyard.

The temple trust runs akshay patra scheme in which lakhs of people per day being served with jot food.",1
"Beautiful Hindu temple. Also try the food available there Watch the movie show at the temple.

Good place to visit. Nice food . Clean and calm. Maintained the calmness. Queue system is well taken care.,1
"Look.at the temple art ,it's location n the sense of divinity.chant the name of the Lord n seek blessings. It's a temple of peace..",1
"Nice place, spacious, well lit hall, perfect for 150add people, withe the great abode Lord Sri Krishna",1
Modern because it's clean and calm at the same time. One has to go early in the morning to see how calm it is. The Prasada they give is like the best which you won't get anywhere in the world plus it has that spiritual touch. Don't miss this at any cost,1
"Coming to ISKCON is always Devine experience. ISKCON is well connected by Buses, Ola & Uber and autos. It is very different from other ISKCON temples in terms of its structure. ne gets a feeling of visiting ancient time building. There are some wonderful statues in temple hence must visit for people visiting Bangalore. Good time is early morning or after 4 pm as one has to walk up and down on marble floor which get very warm during the day time in summers.",1
"A Holy place to visit in Bangalore. Generally crowded. On the Hillock, on Chord Road. There is also a Pure Veg Restaurant, where you can get great meals, but a little bit on the expensive side.",1
"Lots of eating options available on your way down. Don't forget to stop and sample all that you like dosa, samosa etc",1
"It is situated on main Tumkur Road .A vary big temple with lot of stairs.Statues are nice, a worth visiting for Krishna lovers.",1
A temple with some wonderful statues of various Hindu gods. Arouses a divine feeling and serves some tasty and awesome Prasadam. A good place to visit especially in the evenings. An excellent restaurant run by ISKCON rightly called The Higher Taste serves some delicious Satvik food. A must visit place.,0
"This is a popular place and people from other places like to visit the Temple.
The ""Akhyaya Patra"" scheme of ISKCON is world famous. They provide mid day meals to a large number of schools around Bangalore.
""Higher Taste"" in ISKCON campus is by far the best vegetarian (no onion, no garlic to boot) resturant in Bangalore. I have visited with family & friends many times for buffet lunch and find the food very satisfying. Hihly recommended.",1
A modern structure with glass facade.I personally did not get a feeling of being in a temple. If you set aside thoughts how a temple should be you can visit the place like you would visit any place of interest.,1
"Been here many times.
Peace full inside temple but outside traffic is pathetic.
They have very nice parking.",1
This is a beautiful temple with spread out in a huge area in the city centre. The temple has perfect peace of mind. You can spend an hour or 2 peacefully.,1
"ISKCON temple located at Rajajinagar, Bangalore has an excellent ambiance and calmness for any devotee to offer prayers. A lot of buses are there reach this holy temple.We visited the temple last week with family. The metro train also passes in front of the temple",0
"A well organised entry, car-parking and the queque system.
A mind calming walk up the hill with chants of Hare Rama....
The sanctum sanctoriam is an awe- inducing hall of splendour and divinity.
The ever patient and calm volunteers add a halo to the experience.
A visit worth to make with family and friends.
Not the one to pass up if you are in Bangalore.",1
"Its a very beautiful temple of Lord Sri Krishna located on a hill which adds to the beauty, very vibrant atmosphere with bhajans happening inside the main hall.",1
"It is a very nice place to visit, calm and peaceful place, very good for introspection. Take some time and do a relaxed visit, don't rush it.",1
"Neat clean temple.
Not very long waiting line.
Should go from tile area where you can chant ""hare rama, hare krishna"".
Below temple there is one shopping mall, but now they have given an option to skip it.
Nice and cheap restaurant.",1
The temple is very nice well organized you will get Darshan easily and spend time.if you are interested in devotional books you will get very good collection you can get organic food very tasty and pure.,1
If you have never been to any of the isckon temples then you should definitely visit this Temple. The experience to reach the main Temple via those steps while chanting hare Rama hare Krishna is very good. I personally really liked the idea.,1
"For a first time visit to Bangalore, ISKCON should be on your itinerary. The temple is beautiful and it has interesting architecture. As a temple the decorum needs to be kept but ISKCON is more accepting.",1
This year jan i went to iskcon temple with my parents.it is wonderful place for with a beautiful temple.After visiting temple there are shops on the exit where you can buy peoducts sold at good price.,1
"One of the most clean, wonderful spiritual places in Bangalore.
Make sure to ask for yoga for happiness and many such program's which are wonderful in case you stay in bangalore",1
This is a great temple to visit in Bangalore. Recommend to go with someone local so you understand the customs / process.,0
"ISKCON temple is a must visit place for a religious person in Bangalore. The temple is always well organised. I have visited it a couple of times on New Years as well and the crowd was well managed. The Radhe Krishna, Krishna & Balarama and the Chaitanya Mahaprabhu idols are beautifully decorated. Overall the place gives a sense of peace.",1
"Lord krishna temple doesn't need any review.
Hare Rama Hare Krishna
Krishna Krishna, hare hare

Hare Rama Hare Rama
Krishna krishna hare hare",1
"I went to Iskcon after a gap of almost 10 years, not sure how was the experience last time but this time it seems to be good.
First thing first, they have ample parking so no need to worry - one has to somehow reach beating traffic in Bangalore. The way they have constructed four temples (one above the other) is a visual treat. The main temple has a lot of place to sit and enjoy the spiritual music. What follows after darshan is something many people may not like but I was fine. First, one has to necessarily go through all the spiritual / book stalls and then one will see a lot of food on sale. It is like a mall in my opinion. The only complain i have is the temple authorities should mention at the top itself the free food is served at the very end. What really happens is people get excited after looking at a lot of food options and they end up eating after which they have no appetite to enjoy the deliciously free meals. Overall we had good experience.",1
"This temple was little different from other temples we visited.
entrance fee 300 rs
Pair of shoes 2 rs

You have to go some security check and you have to wear proper dress

Toilets are indian.

Everything was very nice, you should definitely visit it when you are in bangalore.

I missed some prayers explanation which we did and some short explanation of Gods. Just some screen with few sentences would be enough.

They ask for donation for food for children, we wanted to give them 300 rs but they refused as 500 is minimum :(",1
"Good temple i like the temple,
Nicely maintained, cleanliness and queue for footwear and bags, etc.
Good place to buy things for worship like books, and other articles, prices are reasonable.
Food served is good but limited space to sit and eat. Parshad is also nice.",1
"Your soul just calms down as soon as you step in the place, the chanting music, the aroma of incense sticks just wipes off all your stress.",1
"This is probably the best place in Bangalore to have some peace and spiritual relaxation. There is a queue for darshan, but the queue moves very fast and as soon as you come out, you get khichadi prasadam which is simply awesome.",1
I liked Iscon temple and I am devotee of lord krishna. Very fast darshan and will feel spirituality in Temple .,1
"Located near the ypr station, the temple complex is probably the best place is Bangalore to have some peace and relaxation. The temple itself is beautiful and worth a visit.",1
Commercialization of Hindu temple at peak. Maintanence is good. Prasad is tasty but cost is high. You can skip if you looking to visit temple for peace,1
We went to this temple at evening time. Temple architecture was very good but not feeling like this is temple as many merchandise shops were in side this temple except this temple is okay for time pass only,1
Place is very good and clean. But only concern is like super market they are selling the people . can consider this place as commercial place.,1
"ISKCON Temple Bangalore, a beautiful and nice place to worship, huge Radhe Krishna temple with great infra, but you will be forced to pay money at entrance by some pandit ji. The temple is great, huge, clean give beautiful darshan of radhe krishna, and you will find peace, music and nice songs of bhakti is good.
There is a huge market place below mandir complex managed by ISKCON Temple.
Overall it nice to visit but I dont like the attitude of pandit ji of asking money for darshan.",1
"This could be a wonderful place for the tourists who love Lord Krishna.... who represents a free and loving spirit...

The cleanliness and the spirit of the place is nicely created and maintained...

The food served as prasadam is of high quality....

What's jarring is the visitors being forced to chant hare Rama hare Krishna",1
If you are looking for some peace then visit the temple. It is commercialized but very well maintained too. The idol is magnificent and it is a great place of meditation. They distribute tasty prasad as well,1
"One of the marble temples which is well maintained. Don;t go in shorts or sleeveless you will not be allowed inside.

Its located on a hill which is a highlight. Either you visit for worship or to have a look at the engineering. Its good.",1

Be sure to carry a shawl / pull over - as you are not allowed to enter in Shorts or with shoulderless dresses.",1
"Wonderful trip to meet Lord Krishna .
Godly presence of dear Radha and Krishna is joyous harmony and union üôèüèª",1
"like most iskcon temples, this one too is worthy of being on a sightseer's list, more so because it is located on a hill, which makes it a sight to behold at night with all the lights. then it looks like a sort of 'hanging temple'",1
"although the temple is good but I personally felt that it's a pure money making business inn the name of GOD by the temple staff . However, the God will never judge his followers by the financial status but then his protectors are discriminating the people in such a way . That's a shame",1
"The ISKCON temple in Bengluru is a large one, with a mix of modern and old architecture. The temple is as clean as possible, despite a quite large daily footfall. The tranquil environment can be felt by spending some time at the main prayer hall.",1
Really You get Piece of mind in this temple & Bajan & Prasada was good you really see once in life .,1
"Apart from Temple, they have function hall. Its maintained very clean with huge crowd moving in/out. Very good Architecture. I had privilege of seeing the temple right from construction stage",1

"Beautiful structure, Serene amongst the bhajans. The Lord adorns this beautiful temple amidst all the grandeur and fervor of his bhakts. A must visit for those who wish to experience the power of human positivity.
Additionally, loads of souvenirs, books, incense sticks and artifacts for the shopaholics and excellent vegetarian food (both budget and high end) for the hungry.",1
"The temple is very well maintained. It's spotlessly clean and is being built in the recent times. Dedicated to Lord Krishna and Radhaji, this temple is a Krishna cult temple.
Aarti is being preformed here every morning and evening. Aarti is a lively worship of the deities by the entire devotees group singing bhajans and chanting Krishna mantras.",1
I visited ISKON temple three years back. Its having good and peace full atmosphere. A must visiting temple.,1
"This place is highly commercialized, so if you are seeking spiritual feel. I am not sure, you will get it here. Still I appreciate the charity works done by Management",1
Nice place to visit. Temple is for lord Radha and Krisna. It will take around 1.5 to 2 hrs to visit full premises. Temple is very neat and clean.you will get good view from the top floor.,0
"We went to ISKCON temple couple of times. We have always enjoyed going to this temple on WOC Road however, we fell it's a bit commercialized with lot of shops to buy food stuff, apparel etc. But, that's still okay as it's a requirement of modern society. Place is very clean and once you enter the place of worship, you can listen to krishna chants that is very peaceful. Overall, a great spiritual outing.",1
"I think even if not a local , one of the must visit places in Bangalore and have plenty of time since it is a big walk and some quality time with god as well",0
"Very nice place to visit, Krishna temple, visit evening for pleasant weather, recommend for tourists",0
Had visited this on a business trip . The architecture is very good and the place is well maintained / near and clean,1
I was wearing shorts when I visited the temple but everything was prepared for such visitors. I rented a cloths to put over my shorts and I was ready to participate in the tour. There were no others visiting the site at the same time so everything was smooth. Monks are all friendly describing what we are supposed to do and painting on the ceiling and the statues were beautiful. It was an interesting experience for me.,1
Visit in Iskcon temple is amazing experience of my life. It is beautiful and well maintained and crowd is more there,1
The temple is really beautiful with gold and marble Idols and decoration around. Simple yet wholesome food is served free for all devotees.,1
"It's huge and well maintained temple like most of the ISKCON properties around the world. The only issue here is crowd and long queues, so keep some extra time at your hand if you want to go there.",1
"Being in ISKCON is amazing experince. You just forget all your tensions & worries as you enter the premises. Sit down in main temple, close your eyes & just be in touch with Lord Krishna. He will bring you peace of mind.",0
"those who have seen the Jain temples of India with their impeccably kept manner, their cleanliness, would love the ISKCON premises.Very systemically designed by the best brains of the country they are a welcome site to visit many times over.The fact that they are welcome to people from all religions is a point in their favour unlike certain other temples...a must visit...
P.S.they are trail blazers in having a fan following on FB twitter et al",1
"I went on a weekday evening. So luckily i did not get the crowd although the place can really be packed. Walk along the path chanting Hare Rama Hare Krishna, its that peaceful feeling. The sanctum sanctora is a lot of gold and glitz and is a sight to watch if you are ok with the idea of bling in a temple. The eatery below serves delicious food especially sweets cooked in ghee. Make sure you get to watch the sunset over the hills. Its a great sight.",1
"Located in north Bangalore this temple sprawling over a large expanse firstly strikes one with the cleanliness n the social discipline as shown by everyone visiting n paying obeisance to the deities. There is no mad scramble, no jostling n yelling as devotees quietly await their turn in a queue either silent or talking softly. One can easily spend a couple of hours in these divine environs.",1
"one of best place to visit in Bangalore , you will get peace of mind , good info about humanity and how to lead life this you will get by speaking with the good people in temple.",0
"ISKCON Temple complex Bangalore is a very peaceful place once inside; its only painful to get in! if traffic on the road doesn't get you, the boisterous devotees thronging the temple will, even though the temple authorities have taken utmost care to ensure that the people are least bothered. Cleanliness, hygiene, is a class apart.
The extremely beautiful insides of the temple and the soulful spiritual music / bhajans will certainly transport every soul to another world!
Routing the visitors through various shopping/eating areas in the complex is quite tedious and unnecessary - not that they are boring or unhygienic, but those who do not want to needn't - purely my personal opinion.
Definitely worth a visit, if not many.",1
"ISKCON, Chord Road Bengaluru has become a landmark and must-do on the Blore visitor's list today. We have been life members since the last 12 ours, so is our son. The temple is an architectural marvel, the shrines of Lord Narasimha & Bhakta Prahalada, Sri Venkateshwara and the main temple housing Sri Krishna. Sri Balarama and other dieties are a visual treat. Their books/magazines are published in multiple languages. It delights both the Indian and International soul. The ""Prasadam"" is tasty and pure (no garlic, onion!) It has a fine dining restaurant, amphitheatre, clean washrooms, large parking space, proper facilities for footwear, easy access for senior citizens...these amenties add to the ease and joy of visit",1
"If you are in Bangalore, one of the iconic places is to visit this temple. Being a holy place, it's beautiful to spend few minutes in prayer no matter whatever faith you believe in. It just connects you in prayers and am sure it would reach your respective God that you believe in. My prayers are with the team who runs this temple and keeping the sanctity intact. My prayers and gratitude to them...",1
One of the most wonderfully managed and beautifully built Iskcon Temples that I have ever visited... It is a must visit for ever traveler visiting Bengaluru...,1
ISCON TEMPLE worth appreciating and experiencing monumental piece of art and sculpture.Environment of temple is peaceful.However certain sectors are more commercial oriented.visit is not recommended for senior citizens above 65 and people with weak heart due to steep stairs,1
"My trip to the temple was both awe inspiring and spiritually uplifting.
The energy is electric and the beauty and architecture inside is so beautiful and the chanting and prayers soulful.
The murthis are a work of art and i left feeling spiritually uplifted !",1
Definitely a must visit place in bangalore. One of the most well maintained and beautiful temples in bangalore.,0
"The temple itself is reached after a security check. There is no photography allowed in the temple, although I did see people using cellphone cameras. The temple itself (inside) is quite ornate with a lot of gold decorations, but it is not old. What spoils the visit for many is the fact that in order to leave the visitor is forced to snake past many food counters, book sellers and souvenir sellers. For those who wish, or need, a free bowl of dal is offered very near the exit. Leave your shoes in the car or check them, as you must visit barefoot. There is parking on site.",1
"There is no bar on caste, creed or sex to visit this temple. It is prevalent in other temples. Lord Krishna is worshiped mainly through bhajans. No prior experience is required to chant these soothing syllables. Its takes about 30 to 45 minutes to have a glimpse of all decked up Gods & appreciate the temple architecture. You have an opportunity to carry the details of Gods in the form of books, cds etc., Next and the last thing is the delicious edibles... Its completely vegetarian & also cooked without onion & garlic; but the varieties are amazing... ""Krishna Prasad"" is delicious...",1
"The temple has acquired a hill and it is on hill top. you have to climb lot of stirs, Incase you wish to skip que go for special durshan by payin 300 Rs. Very well built, truly majestic but commercial.",1
"If you're looking for a peaceful and spiritual day. This is the right place. The place is very organised. Don't forget to try the bakety products. Also, the prasad served at the end is amazing. Really enjoyed the visit.",1
"A bit out of the city is that massive Krishna temple. As a foreigner impressive to see such a big temple that attracts thousands of people everyday. Also interesting tomsee how commercialised the Krishna movement is with DVDs, books etc. to buy.",1

Went with my parents and the experience quite Devine. Never expected such a big place in mid of the city. The temple is quite humongous. It's really systematic clean and properly managed by the temple committee. Overall a very nice soothing place to medicate and pray.,1
Really beautiful place to get enlightened on Holy Shri Krishna. The morning darshan is especially soothing to the mind. Saatwik food and prasad is a great delight to see,1
"We had heard a lot about this temple, its structure, arrangements and puja and we had a long desire to visit this. When we visited this temple, we were amazed to see the well designed and laid out grand structure with a very disciplined and organized management of the visitors. Be it various puja places, prasad and souvenir shops, every place was worth visiting. We really were happy to undertake this visit which a memory to treasure !!",1
"A place where GOD recides (actually it's everywhere ) is a place where one cane open his heart.. among her busy schedule places like ISKON temple help us to be momentarily be with one self and help us talk to our soul.

At ISKON, people are working hard and trying their best for everyone to get the darshan of radhe-krishna : the eternal beautiful friendship or love..",1

"Beautifully architectured Temple - a combo of traditional and modern archtecture, The temple is located on West Of Chord Road, Rajajinagar. ISKCON is a very popular destination accesible by Metro, Public transport, Auto,and Cabs, planing to take your car - well there is plenty of parking space.

As you enter the huge and sprawling complex - Everything is organised very well. There is an orderly queue system - .after completing the mandatory security check, First you get a darshan of Lord Narasimha followed by a darshan of Lord Venkateshwara. Finally you climb to the top of the hill and enter the main temple to view Lord Krishna and Radha. The golden sanctum sanctorum, the marble flooring, the colourful paintings on the walls makes the darshan a great experience.

After the darshan, there are many things to do in the temple complex - you can view a animation film on Krishna in the theatre or you can visit the innumerable shops to buy the various products on sale - statues, photos, books and many other items. There are many food stalls and also a restaurant. You can even buy cakes (eggless of course). And before leaving you can savour the prasad, which is delicious. Maintenance of the temple is excellent, the place is very clean and everything is well organised.

A very important thing to note about ISKCON is its Akshay Patra scheme. ISKCON provides free food to lakhs of school going children as a part of the mid-day meal scheme. The maintainance of kitchen, the cleanliness, use of modern cooking technologh and logistics is amazing.

If you wish to be a donor or be part of any of their programs you can approach the temple authorities.

If you are in Bangalore, make sure you visit ISKCON. You can easily spend a couple of hours in peace, getting the blessings of the Lord Krishna and also having a relaxing time.

After the darshan of Lord Krishna and various other temple within the same complex, ISKCON also has vegetarian restaurant, the food served is Sathvik, a very good place for the vegetarians, seating arrangement is good (loved the sofas) and the service is satisfying, calm n peaceful ambience, with bhajans in the background, they have a very good variety in Buffet dinner starting from starters to deserts. The taste is good like I mentioned earlier service is at its best. They never haunt around you while eating but when you need them they will be in front of you very quickly.

Overall, I definitely recommend this place and I have been a devotee of ISKCON for over 20 years now.",1

"The temple arrangement is excellent like all ISKCON temples in India and the idol darshan of Lord Krishna with Balaram and Radha is spiritually uplifting. Do try the various prasad offered once you complete the darshan. The restaurant too is good, and offers a good spread of indian & chinese dishes.",1
"I stay in Bangalore. I had been to this place twice. this place is perfect family tour. Things to do : Visit to temple, varieties of materials related to puja items, lunch by akshay patra.

Devotional place ..spacious .nice view from temple top of the city. Lots of foods to eat inside temple . Well maintained-neat and clean,1
Temple is beautiful .Nicely built.Doing pooja nicely.Here poojari dont force for donation .I giving one star less because inside so many shops are there and they sell items for higher price.Must visit place.I dont prefer to buy anything inside its campus.,0
This temple is one of the best ISKCON I have ever seen before...great ambiance and service. Must visit place in Bangalore,1
"You should see this when in Bangalore, but to have this rated as one of the top things to do is confusing to me. Yes, the temple is beautiful, but photos aren't allowed. While in the temple, you spend more time being ushered through endless shops than in the actual worship areas. The whole thing felt like more of a money grab and proselyting ploy. You should see this, but don't expect it to be the highlight of your time in Bangalore.",1
"We have been to ISKCON temple, we have bought for 300 rupees (3 persons) tickets. With this tickets we had somekind of vip access, and that made everything very nice to visit. If you are in Banglore don't miss this out.",1
A remarkable place. The splendour & quiet of the main sanctum erases all the discomfort of reaching there.,1
I visited ISKCON temple with my friends. It is must visit place in bangalore. When you reach there you find peace .,1
"Spiritual Park is the right word to express this location. Very calm, almost weekend we spend our times here. Will get some food to purchase and Prasadas also. Go on evenings and be the part of Aarthi performing here.",0

nice visit. although the never ending gift shops may put off ppl. but do try some of the foods at these shops. they are amazing,0
"ISKCON is famous for its grandeur and beauty wherever it is established. I visited this temple in August last year with my family and had no problem in throughout the 'darshan' process. The entry, queue and darshan is very well managed in and around the temple. The temple is very clean and ofcourse no photos are allowed inside the temple. The visual of the Lord Krishna's idol and the decor is simple amazing and breath taking. After the 'darshan', the queue ends up at commercial stalls lined up to sell prasad/books/clothes/food and accessories. Please check the timings before visiting the temple to avoid standing outside the temple if the gates are closed.",1
"We've came to the ISKCON temple with a local friend. We had a wonderful experience and learned some things about Krishna God from the book store. We also attended a small 10 minutes ceremony dedicated to Krishna God.
It is a very peaceful place.
At the end we received some food, very good. and as well some sweets also very tasty.",0
"There is a long entrance line where you can check your shoes and large bags (which are not allowed in the temple) and get a token to retrieve them later. You are required to wear appropriate clothing which includes having neither your shoulders nor legs visible. I had not done my due dilligence and I showed up in shorts. After selling me a ticket for 500 rupees (apparently I needed a special access ticket different from most people), they told me they would supply me with appropriate garments. Sure enough after the luggage and shoe check and just before the entrance they rented me a wrap around to cover my legs. 20 rupees + 500 rupee refundable deposit. I appreciate that they had this available as I do wish to respect their place of worship. The people were all helpful and friendly, showing me how to tie the wrap around. It was odd being in a line and along a different path than 99% of the visitors.
The special entry pass allowed viewing of 5 separate areas and participation in a short ceremony that included hand washing, touching of flowers and changing. It also included a couple of gifts including a yummy snack, a book written in Kannada and a box I haven't opened yet.
From early on in my visit I had a strong feeling of cognitive dissonance. Later in more tour I have explicit issues I can identify that caused it but the feeling started before any of these.

Specifically, after the main tour there is an area with signage explaining the Krishna religion. Two struck me, one was of a fish in a beach chair (labeled fish out of water), I definitely identified with that fish. Another explained how it was material things could not lead to happiness or clear thinking. After passing this area I passed through the most extensive set of gift shops, shopping areas and food sales I have ever seen in a religious institution. Towards the end the was an odd juxtaposition of signs for a paid lunch and others for a free lunch. At the very end they were offering a free bowl of some type of porridge. I feel I offended them by not accepting but by that point I was anxious to leave.

This temple really is an outstanding piece of architecture and the people seemed genuinely friendly and helpful. YMMV.",1
"Looking for peace in IT City, this is the right place. Very neat and clean. Architecture is magnificent. Prefer to go early morning.",1
Must visit Temple in bangalore. What a divine feeling is this temple. Also food available is good. Better to go empty stomach to taste various food,1
Iskcon temple is one of the best and popular temple. Here we can feel fully maditational mind and peace full feelings.,1
Beautiful temple and it looks so good with its lighting in the evening .. we had a very good darshan ..,1
"This is the biggest temple in Bengaluru, most famous with the budha and Hari Krishna preyers, there are many pray stations and all the people must follow the stations and it's a long time to do all the way. For me it was not so great but it was quite nice... I think that if you not have the time you can skip on that.",1
"My wife and I stayed overnight at Iskcon specifically to witness the early morning aarthi and abhishekam. The stay was wonderful, people were nice and the prasadam at the temple was delicious.
The 4:15 a.m aarthi was out of the world. This was a great experience for us. We had a 4 month old baby with us al along and she too seem to enjoy the stay.",1
I visited three temples including this one and it was so unique and beautiful. I enjoyed seeing the incredible architectural details and the attention to detail that made this such a beautiful temple.,0
This is a beautiful Krishna temple. Very nicely built and ideal time is to visit in the mornings and spend some time.,0
"I personally felt that this was way too much commercialized, right from the books to over priced eateries, shops it was more like a crowded hangout place",0
"Devotee or not, just visit the temple for its architecture. It brings a lot of peace to mind.
Well connected by public transport.",0
Its a very nice place to experience. The temple is very well maintained and managed. Definnitely worth a visit in Bangalore.,1
"As usual beautiful like all other ISKON in the middle of the city.
All krishna lover head to this one.",1

"The temple is beautifully constructed with magnificent interiors embellished with embossed gold surfaces. Its kept spic and span and the priests are also very nice and they are easy to talk to. My six year old son had questions about the golden interior work which they happily answered.
Its little away from the main city so the travel time plus the visit there would require approx. 4 hours. they do have a canteen there where one can eat. the temple premises also has a restaurant with lunch buffet and ala-carte options. Though, I feel it was overly priced at 750 per person since its on the temple premises and claims to offer Satvik food.
Isckon Temple is one place I would definitely take my parents when they visit. the atmosphere is very peaceful and serene. I would have given it 5 points, however, there is one thing I kind of disliked is the packages they share for offering to God. the rate card is a put off. But, it may be good for transparency sake and they definitely need donations for maintaining the property well.",1
"From the rash and rale of society outside the gate to a world of calm inside... A peaceful environ once you enter. Also note that the temple has been well organized. You can also meet other devotees and the priests, who have Das suffixed to their name, because they submit to the deity. A good collection of trinkets and merchandise too for those who would be interested to buy books and collectibles.",1
"Very nice place, feel calm being there, very quit & relaxable to sit inside the temple, & most of a thing you will really enjoy the food items sold there, very good variety of food with a great taste",1

Every religious place should follow this. The devotion would come automatically once you reach the main temple place inside the huge complex. There is separate line for physically abled persons. There is also separate shopping area & food court.",1

"When you live in Bangalore, this seems to be the first place that comes to mind when someone asks a place they can visit. The buildings are beautiful, you can have some peace and quiet and the temple showcases life of Lord Krishna in various ways.
You can buy a lot of stuff (clothes, memorabilia) which seems to be at a fair price.

Try to wear decent clothing ( no shorts). Don't worry if you do walk in shorts. The temple folks will rent clothes for Rs. 20 only.",1
Very very nice and peace place to see this god and well developed construction in city of view. It's very nice made up of stone,1

"The temple is very well made with both Interior and exterior at its best...Had been to ISKCON Temple in Bangalore many times. You will see all well educated Dasas managing the temple. the Chanting of Hare Krishna Hare Rama inside the temple will take you to a different world.

A must visit for anyone who believe in Hindusim and Lord Krishna...",1
"Clean, well organised temple. The priests looked educated and treated devotees with respect. Plenty of literature around Lord Krishna and History is available along with eateries and prasadam. Suggest arrive by cab or public transport",1
A beautiful temple with a very transcendental environment. The Gods will surely bless you with some mouth-watering sweets and prasaadam at the lower floors.,1
"We visited this temple on the recommendation of many others who had visited before. It, unfortunately, was not to my family and my liking. The temple was far too commercialised. After queueing up in a dated, cramped, fenced off area, once you are through to go in, you pay to put your shoes away, bags away, and I even ended up having to pay a refundable deposit for a shawl to cover my legs up (don't wear shorts, or skirts without something to cover your legs when visiting), plus a further few rupees to cover laundry costs.

Once inside, you are rushed through in order to keep the queues flowing. A priest blessed those who offered donation, but abruptly stopped when he felt more donations were required. Once inside the main temple, you are offered the chance to get to the front for a fee. Otherwise you continue to queue at a distance and be ushered through and told to keep moving along.

Once you have visited, you are led out through an endless gift shop, which seems bigger than the temple! Prasad was free (!) and generous however.

If you want something to tick off the list, then this is a good place to visit, but it left us feeling rather frustrated and we took the decision to avoid the bigger temples after this.",1

People who are new to Bengaluru or on a visit should include this location as part of their city tour. Worth it!,1
Good place .. Nice Temple ..Temple with with amusements and lord darshan.. spend time in peace ..buy handicrafts,0
The calming effect that the temple has on you is extra-ordinary. In these stressful times does help to remember God and do some introspection,1
"A magical experience awaits you here. If you are the spiritual kind, come and witness the place that elevates you spiritually. If you get a chance, go for their early morning or the late evening puja which is mesmerizing. Their prashad is divine and the whole experience leaves you ecstatic. Hare Krishna!",1
Very nice place.All the way you will find mesmerizing architecture & various stages of life of Lord KRISHNA.Very nice & calm place. You will definitely feel relaxed.,1
Visiting temple was good but the whole complex is highly commercialized. Prices are way too high than the worth of products.,1
"You get a lot of positive vibes while you enter the temple and Visit all the small temples and finally reach the main temple on top of the Hillock. You can Drive up or walk up not very long queues, except for the festivals. I suggest walking up since its difficult to get parking inside the temple sometimes.",1
"This temple is intersting as a large Hare Krishna temple. It is worth a visit, if you are near.
Be aware: you need to cover your full legs and shoulders (they have long sarongs available), and cannot take your camera/bags inside. For women bringing a (small) purse is fine.
There are a lot of stairs to climb, and in summer the marble floors can be VERY hot.",1
"Divine Sacred place, rather than pointing it as temple i would say those who seek blessings of their atma, can get the vibration here",1
Well organized and beautiful temple in Bengaluru. The view over the city in front of the temple just as enjoyable as the stunning carvings and ornaments inside. Must visit when in the city.,1
This is truly a divine place that instantly gives you peace of mind. Very pleasant and Heavenly experience. Prasaad is just awesome and this temple is such a beautiful place. Jai Shree Krishna ‚ò∫Ô∏è,1
"This is a must visit spot when you are in Bangalore. From the architecture to the vibes and the energy, you won't be sorry spending a few ours here. The only downside is that it is a tad commercial but then that's pretty much the case with most devotional places these days. But the overall experience is memorable. The chanting (whether you are a believer or not) is very mesmerizing and the food choices are yummy. The system is very well organised and even with a huge crowd, things are managed pretty well. If you are in Bangalore and have a few hours to spare, consider this.",1

The main temple architecture is very good and we had a peaceful time during our visit",1

"One of the best places in Bangalore. The temple's located far away from the city, but you can always take the metro from Mantri Square from downtown to reach there. Elaborately and exquisitely designed indoors is a treat for the eyes and the heart. Don't forget to sample the praasadms on offer.",1
"We visit frequently this temple and is generally crowded, given the huge fan following this temple has build up over the years.

On weekend, it gets especially crowded and saturday evening can be slight nightmare if you come with your car as getting a parking lot can be an herculean task. Taking metro can be an option now but then depends on your starting location.

if you are coming with elderly people or people with disability, they have a special lift to take you close to the main temple, circumventing the long queue (but would request not to find loophole and misuse this facility).

The main sanctum is amazingly decorated and one can spend hours in this place. Best way to spend sometime here, is to move awy from the main darshan space and occupy the main courtyard, from where you can get a good view of the gods and also won't be pushed away by the security and temple authority.

The way out of the temple has lots of art work and also the eating place (my favourite).

If you are going with elderly people and kids, ensure all are moving together as the huge crowd can scatter your family members.

Nice place to spend a morning or evening but may not be entire day.",1
"In early morning we visited this radha Krishna temple really very nice atmosphere with very neat & clean temple
And we entered to the temple and spent near about 2hours there.itbis really nice temple.",1
"Divine Sacred place, rather than pointing it as temple i would say those who seek blessings of their atma, can get the vibration here",1
Well organized and beautiful temple in Bengaluru. The view over the city in front of the temple just as enjoyable as the stunning carvings and ornaments inside. Must visit when in the city.,1
This is truly a divine place that instantly gives you peace of mind. Very pleasant and Heavenly experience. Prasaad is just awesome and this temple is such a beautiful place. Jai Shree Krishna ‚ò∫Ô∏è,1
"This is a must visit spot when you are in Bangalore. From the architecture to the vibes and the energy, you won't be sorry spending a few ours here. The only downside is that it is a tad commercial but then that's pretty much the case with most devotional places these days. But the overall experience is memorable. The chanting (whether you are a believer or not) is very mesmerizing and the food choices are yummy. The system is very well organised and even with a huge crowd, things are managed pretty well. If you are in Bangalore and have a few hours to spare, consider this.",1
"Hii, i visited Iskon temple with my friends. Its really good place and nice botanical set way of temple inside. Inside awesome architectural ceiling and gold plated eye catching design, good reflection of positive vibrations. Thanks.",1
"Very well organised complex. Housekeeping is excellent.
We bought special Darshana for the family @ 300/=. This made us to cut the queue and near access to the god. This also enabled Prasadam and concession on books . Bought Bhagavadgeeta .
The organic food items by their in house dairy are excellent. The eggless backers items which are offered to god are available on sale.
The main temple architecture is very good and we had a peaceful time during our visit",0

Location wise excellent and situated in hill top and nice pleasant climate can be enjoyed in this temple.,1
"One of the largest ISKCON temples beautiful and well maintained and busy temple too. Modern Type of temple, clean and built with amenities which lags in most of the temples. Many foreigners visit this place and is quite popular. Large place and be prepared to walk up and down the stairs in a line. Choose non holiday day to visit where you can enjoy the temple better. It is easily a family event for 2 to 3 hours well spent!",1
"It is really a gorgeous and most beautiful temple in Bangalore and offers the most attractive religious views that touch the heart. Here for ISKCON temple, you can book the cab from Bharat Taxi which making available the taxi services for entire the city of Bangalore.",1
The visit was great but there are lots of selling joints inside the temple which should not be there at a spiritual place,1
"The temple opens in 4 pm. Visit the temple... very peaceful place.. Wonderful to visit. Enjoy the Canteen area...Foods served here are yummy, wonderful, tasty. One can buy Souvenirs sold inside the temple. Must visit.",0
"We visited on Radhayatra day, in the evening you feel like it is heaven. We have taken 108 Hare rama steps to go inside, that's an awesome experience.

Balaji temple and Main temple Idols are amazing, you will forgot everything when you are inside the. Main Temple.

Organizing this are pretty well, i suggest you to visit after 5pm.",0
"ISKCON Temple of Bangalore is well maintained but more of commercial than devotional.
Consider paying a visit once if you are in Bangalore. It would take around an hour for the complete walkthrough around the temple facility.",1
"Quite modern temple, but a nice experience. A place of peace in the busy city of Bangalore. Nice view over the city.",1
Leave your mind and only carry your heart ~ rest is all your experience. Worth a visit. Sit in silence as long as you can and watch the vigrahas > you experience calmness.,1

"Went there in the month of June it was raining that that and it has created a little mess. But on crowed it has no effect, place was still crowded, i was able to witness one of the evening aarti, the main temple decoration is beautiful. It is done with lots of flowers.
This place also has outlet which sells fastfood, but it was cold. One pure veg restaurant is also there in the campus, i didn't had food there but in Mumbai Iscon it was delicious.",0
Well maintained as you expect from Iskcon administration. Prasadam is good and tasty. You can also buy souvenirs for your family and friends.,0
I visit this place very often. I like the temple very much. If your want spiritual please visit this place.,1
"This is a large and beautiful temple. Unlike many temples we have visited in India, it is not ancient. It was completed, I believe, in the 1990s. It is very beautiful and quite large. It is the largest eat ISKVON temple in India and one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world. The views of the city from the climb to the temple were very nice. The visit is a self-guided tour with signs explaining various areas, beliefs, rituals, etc. of the Krishna belief.

We went in a Sunday night. I think I remember it is open until 8:30pm on Sun. This was a good time to go, as there were not many locals there and basically no tourists. Also, it is cooler at night than during the day. The views of the city at night were also nice.

Although entry is free, if one is a foreigner, they try to get you to pay (around $12US) for the ""short-cut"" line. This might be worth it when there are lots of people there, but I have been told even it can be very crowded. Once in either the long or short line, one must remove and leave their shoes in a bag for pick up afterward. This cost a few rupees. There are also other points along the way requiring, or urging additional fees. All told, including if one pays for the short-cut, maybe $25-$30US).

On the way out, there are lots of little booths selling all manner of items.

All in all, I'd say it's a definite ""should see"" if one is in Bangalore.",1
The temple is well maintained and has many photo views from enterence to the temple there are many views which are beautiful and can be captured. In the temple the painting on the ceiling is eye capturing. And when you look at the sculpture of lord Krishna and Radha it is also very beautiful. The slowing moving to exit just before it is an canteen where many varieties of food is available at reasonable rate. Had a nice time by listening to mantras at the temple and sitting peacefully.,1

But for me it did not give me a feel that i was inside a Temple.may be my perception of a temple is different being a guy from coastal Karnataka( south west of India).",1
ISKON- The temple visited by locals and tourists through our the day..one must have Darshan of Sri Radha Krishna during Arathi in the evening..!,1
"Nice palace in bengaluru . Need to focus on cleaning otherwise all good.
Great Radha krishana temple",1
"Cool place to see, had no clue what to do inside but everyone seemed welcoming. Great place to experience culture.",1
This temple is one of the must see places in Bangalore which is so clean and well maintained temple it's a nice place to meditate at times. Overall a nice place wit all the requirements,1
Must visit place for Krishna devotees. Nice big hall and puja area. Tends to get over crowded on weekends and especially Aarti time. Difficult with small kids. Queues are pretty long on sacred days. Food is okay.,1
"i havent found anything more peaceful than the early morning ..mangal aarti at iskcon.

you can just surrender yourself...and feel super peaceful.",1
"This has become landmark for visitors visting Bangalore.
The restaurant - ""Higher Taste"" serves good veg food.
I love the 8 PM Aarti....its enchanting....
Its the most cleanest temple I have been in India. Devotees singing the bhajans and dancing to the rhythm of the song looks very divine and get the feeling of ecstasy getting immersed in the Lord's devotion and you would love to chant...

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama
Rama Rama Hare Hare.....",1
Nice Temple to visit if you are in Bangalore. Nice and reasonable restaurant/shopping complex inside,1
this is a very sacred temple a must visit temple. A very good encahnting experience with extremely high peace of mind.,1
"I enjoyed this place. Vast complex. Neat and clean. Bought some mithai from here to take home for some devotee friends.

We ended up consuming all of it while on our journeys. It was good, and tasty.

Luckily we picked up more mithai in Mumbai.",1
We had a family visit and enjoyed the Arti and Bhajans! Dinner at the Higher Taste restaurant was just superb!,1
The temple is good in architecture . There is always rush in this temple . The temple is clean . A must visit if you are in Bangalore.No photography allowed inside the temple so keep your cameras in the car or you have to submit it at the start of the temple.,1
I am no one to review or rate a holy place but this place is magical and divine. Try and attend evening aarti and if possible visit on special days like janamashtmi etc.,1
morning aarti of iskon temple made our day very with holy sprite and full of positivity. . prasad they served is very good,1
A place where you can meditate and forget all your cumbursome tasks of life. More such peaceful places be made in the city to help control the effects of modern lifestyle.,1
"One of the cleanest and most orderly temples I have ever visited. People are very courteous. What many visitors are unaware of is that they serve the tastiest meal - in a buffet style, both for lunch and dinner. Aptly termed ""Higher Taste"", the food is purely vegetarian and devoid of Onion and Garlic. We have visited the place several times and our sole regret - each time - was that we could eat only so much. The food is 'out-of-this-World'.",1
This is a beautiful white colored temple located close to Yeshwantpur locality of Bangalore. This is a temple dedicated to Lord Krishna. We visited it at 8 am in the morning. It was the aarti time. Devotees could be seen singing the bhajans and dancing to the rhythm of the song. It was a feeling of ecstasy getting immersed in the Lord's devotion. The temple is very well maintained.,1
"Hare Krishna..Hare Krishna...Krishna Krishna Hare Hare...Hare Rama...Hare Rama...Rama Rama Hare Hare !! One of the beautiful, well organised and clean temples I have ever visited. Very friendly staff, lift for the elderly people/physically challenged people. A must visit to sort the divine blessings!!",1
"While I have visited a couple of ISKCON temples in Europe, the size of this temple is incomparable to those.

The temple is in fact comprised of 2 smaller temples and one ""big"" temple. When we visited, we did a donation of Rs. 1000, which brought us some gifts, including books about the religion.

It should be noted that you need to be ""appropriately"" dressed to visit the temple, but if you happen to be dressed in a short dress, you can rent a long skirt for Rs. 20 with a Rs. 500 deposit.",1
This is one of the biggest ISKON temples. Interior is well designed. A place that everyone can visit. There's a mall(Orion mall) near to this temple.,1
Temple has a beautiful architecture and its a place which we should go and explore but the thing which really irritates me is their high commercialized behavior. Entrance gives you a feel of temple but when you exit you will feel like going out from a MALL.,1
"Its a privilege to write a review on ISKCON Temple, Bangalore. I had been here for at least 5 times by now. Love this temple a lot. ISKCON is very far from where I am staying, but it is the beauty of the temple which made me visit so many times.

The temple is located on a hill and this is clearly visible from the entry gate itself. It is a very big temple. There is a barricade at the entrance of the temple where we must stand in a queue to enter the main gate. From there, we climb up some slope. After climbing, a counter will be there where we have to deposit our mobiles and slippers. Once we do, we move on. Here starts the queue. It is very long, we climb the steps and move on. There is greenery to the left hand side where we go in the queue.

Inside the temple, firstly we shall have darshan of ""Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy"". The statutes are built very beautifully. Secondly, darshan of ""Sri Venkateshwara Swamy"" will be done. Again, the beauty of the deity is not to be missed. Finally, we reach the mandir of ""Lord Sri Krishna"" which is on the top. Awesome design, the crowd, the silence, charisma of Lord Sri Krishna will surely attract any tourist. Lord Krishna will appear in 3 screens, the middle one being Radha and Krishna. Whenever I come to ISKCON, I will surely sit and meditate here for at least 15 minutes.

Once darshan is done, we move on to shopping arcade. Before that, there is a screen which shows how our soul moves in different bodies (child, adult, married man, old man, etc). There is huge shopping arcade as well as eatery. After shopping, we can find the place where we can have free meals. Also, there is a fountain where we can have a photo shoot or sit for some time and chit chat. We move on to collect our belongings (mobile, slippers) and disperse and REVISIT.",0
"It was good experience. I have also gone to kemfort temple. But now kemfort temple is fully comercial. If you want to enter kefort temple, then you have to pay minimum 100rs entery. So iskon temple is better tha kemfort.",1
"Visited the ISKCON Temple's restaurant named ""Higher Taste"".

It's a delight for vegetarians, the buffet spread is large and bountiful, lot of paneer varieties and unlimited indian and western styled sweets.

And it's all cooked in a pure and spiritual atmosphere with an aim that food is the ""prasadam"" an offering to god.

Profit is not the motive, even the food that is left at the end of the day is distributed to charity.

And If you are not at all interested in this 'God' n 'Prasadam' stuff, then this will work for U, ""you can have finger licking, awesome vegetarian food which is not too pricy""

Go at once and you will feel the difference.",1
"Stop a small hillock in the centre of the Bengaluru city is this beautiful temple of Lord srikrishna Raadhaa & Balaraama..Also temple of varaaha Swamy & Lord Venkateshwara.
Huge golden gopuram, vast temple premises, enchanting lighting, walls & ceiling painted with episodes of Krishna's life....
The floral adornments along with vibrant jewellery make the deities a visual treat..
Please visit ..& mind u ..U need 3 hours to imbibe the exterior & the interior beauty..",1
The trip was on 20th Jan 2017. We got only few hours to visit due to change of a train from KSR Bengluru Railway Station. It is around 6 KM from SBC Railway Station Benglore. It takes around 5 Hours to Visit each and every place of the ISKON. Really Hats off to ISKON Bengluru. We have immersed in great Bakthi of Sri Krishna. The Prasadam was awesome taste that was freely distributed by Temple. Many things there to purchase related to Sri Krishna. Awesome Temple and must see narayana temple in Banglore.,1
"Must visit in Bangalore trip. Nice n clean ,can sit and meditate. Small knick knacks are available inside temple which can be bought as souvenirs.",1
The temple is very beautiful and clean. Proper way of entering and exit. Good prasadam. Snacks also available inside.,1
I hv visited to iskon temple with my family and friends the temple is very a atractive and peace full of mind,1
"It is an amazing and calm place. On the entrance of the main temple, they make you go step by step and chant ""Hare ram hare krishna, krishna krishna hare hare"".

The only thing I didn't like was that they have made it a commercial place, the exit from the main temple if like walking in a mall with various shops and everything.",1
"Good place to visit pls visit one time
The place is very good
At there your mind feels relaxed because there is not any loud sounds shouting etc etc",1
"Obviously everyone knows about ISKCON. In this temple premises we found another deities as Lord Venkateswara,Prahallada Narasimha,Srila Prabhupada,Balarama along with the main deity Radha-Krishna.",0
"Leave your shoes in the car or with the shoekeeper (2 rupees/pair) and enter. It's free, so unless you want to buy an offering or blessing, ignore the man doing the hard sell of tickets for 300-1,000 rupees! Also leave your camera in the car. Security check for men and women before entering (mobile phones ok, just no cameras). Walk through and enjoy. Built in May 1997.

Plenty of opportunities to buy Hare Krishna publications (I did buy a vegetarian cookbook here with excellent instructions for Americans w/measurements) for 300 rupees.

Bring an appetite because there are many food vendors within the temple complex to get some snacks and sweets!

30 rules for parking.

Very glad we visited.",1
Like most of temples in India this place is too highly commercialized. Families would love it though.,1
Must see location. Religious site so tourists need to behave and be respectful but it's very nice experience. Shoes need to be removed so there is a lot of barefoot walking...not for everyone.,1
"Well maintained, spotlessly clean, calm place...Must visit even if u r a non worshipper..
Walkable from Orion mall",1
Devotees of krishnA throng here in large numbers to pay tribute to lord krishna. It ia great temple to visit in bangalore.,0
"The ISKCON ( International society of Krishna Consciousness) temple is Bangalore is a beautiful spiritual place which should be on the 'must see' list of any visitor to Bangalore, irrespective of their religious beliefs. The magnificent and opulent temple and the grounds are kept spotlessly clean 24/7 by an army of devotees. The jaw dropping main prayer room is the centerpiece of an architecturally grand structure , which is a fusion of modern glass pyramid with traditional Hindu Gopuram.
While the temple is always crowded and especially so during Festivals, crowd control through proper channels makes the visit a pleasure. The temple also features a beautiful marriage hall with facilities for feeding lavish meals to hundreds of guests . As part of the temple, a commercial kitchen feeds free lunch to thousands of poor school children throughout Bangalore. The temple also features a very upscale vegetarian restaurant 'Higher Taste' which is available for lunch and dinner and is definitely worth a visit.",1
"The temple complex is very huge, there is enough space for car park. Very beautiful architecture. The main area is really done with some creativity, beautifully sculptured pillars and ceilings with Lord Krishna paintings.",1
"This is very nice place, very well maintained and organised, good and spacious temple. Very nice palce to relax and lose yourself in the devotion.",0

It's so peace in here. It's like heaven itself. It's one of Its kind. It's a must visit temple if you are religious.,0
Awesome.nice place to visit.serene and calm.weekends will b slightly crowded but still manageable .don't miss d Prasad.,1
"A very good attractive temple, mesmerizing architecture. It is well built on a hill, it has Lord Lakshmi narasimha, Lord Venkateshwara and Lord Radha Krishna's temples in it.",1
"Attended a wedding function followed by a pure vegetarian meal served at and by the temple.

A clean ambiance with spacious interiors and full privacy to the attendees.

The food was at par with any good vegetarian food of South Indian origin. Clean and with fairly less spices as was expected.

The surroundings were free from clutter and the temple premises has ample parking.

Surprisingly the washrooms were clean and dry and quite contemporary.

A suitable place for conferences and weddings etc.",1
Must visit place for all visitors of Bangalore. No restrictions for based on religion or culture. Anybody can visit and pray to the GOD. Wonderful Architechure and well maintained.,1
"the architectural marvel of a modern temple of Lord Krishna, it is serene and the location on the hillock adds great ambience.
There a sumptuous fare of food which is clean , hygienic and tastes divine.
And what an experience to see the Akshay Patra. Had seen the operation of the Mega Temple Kitchen on the TV but the visit to the Bangalore kitchen was a impressive experience.
God bless the volunteers.Enjoy the Aarti in the evening",0

Usally visit iskon on regular basis.no hassles fr parking n all thing are moniterd in a very proper manner.recommend all to visit once when u r in bangalore.,1
See The photos you will know how beautiful and peaceful it is there . Must visit place .Because it is not allowed to take photos inside the temple but you will be mesmerised by the artwork,1
"I visited the temple on a recent study abroad trip. The temples were unique of course and beautifully designed and executed. I am still figuring out the best ways to appreciate Hindu temples due to the complexity of the faith and how the multiple deities interact, but it was beautiful. The most impactful part however was learning about and getting to tour one of the kitchens of Akshaya Patra, a foundation that provides a mid day meal to over 1.5 million Indian school children a year. Their mission history and the thought they have put into their large kitchens with gravity fed rice cookers that can serve 1,000 and specially designed trucks to carry pots of food to schools within a 45mile radius was so impressive. Makes you think about your privilege in new ways and my responsibilities to my brothers and sisters around the globe. Amazing organization.",1
Krishna temple a must visit attraction. Built on a hillock on a huge place. Well kept and wonderfully managed. Eating places and a restaurant is there. Great for a family visit with children. U can take back sweets and prasad. Not to forget there service kitchen for Akshay patraüëç,1

"ISKON Temple in Bangalore is one of the biggest temples of the city and is one of the most popular tourist attractions. It is located on a hillock called Hare Krishna Hill on a sprawling area of seven acres in the busy area of the city. As a cultural and religious hub it provides a sense of peace and devotion to visitors.The temple is constructed at three levels with three flights of steps. Once you enter, park your vehicle and have to go in a queue to leave your shoes in the shoe stand and then climb further to go for darshan. You can pay Rs. 300/- towards Pushpanjali Seva which allows up to five persons to go through special entry. You will be also given special prasadam and a special rebate of Rs.70/- to buy any religious book from the books displayed in the book stall. After crossing the Raja Gopuram you will see Sri Prahlada Narasimha, a beautiful statue of Narasimha in black marble with staue of Prahlada with folded hands. The lord looks graceful with powerful expression. After climbing another row of steps you can see Lord Venkateswara or Govinda decorated in bright jewels. You can see the metal idols of Sri Devi and Bhu Devi near the Lord. The idol of Venkateswara done in black marble is very attractive decked with shining gold ornaments. Another flight of steps leads you to the main temple of Sri Krishna and Radha. The main hall with a spacious area of 10,000 sq. ft. is a wonderful construction with many beautiful paintings of Krishna Leelas done by Russian painters on the ceiling. Many devotees sit here to sing bhajans and witness the sevas performed to main deities. On the elevated pedestal one can see the gold plated statues of Lord Sri Krishna and His divine consort Radha in graceful poses. On the right side the idols of Sri Krishna and His brother Bala Rama are seen. Both of them look very cheerful with uplifted hands to express their joy and also welcome devotees with blessings. On the left side of the main deities the idols of Nitiai and Gauranga (Nityananda and Chaitanya) are seen. Both of them stand with uplifted hands with a joyous expression of devotion to Lord Krishna. The gold plated idol of Srila Prabhupada (1896-1977) in sitting posture is seen in a separate shrine. He propagated Krishna Bhakti and spread Chaitanya philosophy all over the world by his tireless efforts of giving lectures, writing books and establishing many mutts. This temple was built in 1997 under the able leadership of Madhu Pandit Dasa and Jagath Chandra Dasa who were asked by Srila Prabhupada to establish this temple to promote vedic culture, spiritual learning and social service activities. Many educational and cultural activities are being undertaken by these temple authorities. Protection of cows is another cherished ideal of Hindu philosophy. Here one can see Goshala established in 1986. At present nearly 25 cows are looked after in a very healthy and comfortable manner. Akshaya Patra Foundation started in 2000 has been organizing free midday meal scheme to more than 1.3 million children of Govt. and aided schools in 9 states. Every day the temple organizes free annadanam to all devotees between 11.30 a.m and 2.00 a.m. After you come out of the temple you are led to go down various halls displaying many articles like books, soveneirs, pictures, small toys, idols, clothes, calendars and pooja items. To satisfy your appetite you will also see astonishing varieties of dishes, milk products and beverages. One will feel quite satisfied and peaceful after visiting this temple which has got all facilities and gives you a chance to know about our culture and tradition. The temple is open in the morning from 7.30 am to 1.00 pm and in the evening from 4.15 pm to 8.15 pm.",1

There is food court, bookstall and its very commercialized, but that's why its clean and well managed. If you are lucky you might get annaprasadam also for free on your way out!!

My biggest challenge was to reach the temple due to traffic!! There are parking inside the temple.",0
"The premier temple for Krishna worshippers, this is the cleanest and one of the biggest temples you will find in Karnataka.

The moment you enter the temple premises you get enthralled by Hare Krishna Hare Ram Matra.

Overall very good place to spend quality time with God and family.",1

You go there just to see not for a religious motive.
You will have religious shopping mall also available there.
Build and structure is very good.",1

Well mannered volunteers manage the crowd very well. There are sanctums dedicated to Narasimha and Venkateswara too. A must visit for all who come to Bangalore!!!",1
"Its a grand temple on top of hill hence be ready for a decent walk.
Old people who want to walk less can use elevator directly to main temple entrance. Enough parking. Only -ve is highly commercialized",0
One of best place to visit and know more about Hindu temple and culture. I strongly recommend anyone to visit.,1
Very beautiful interiors of the temple. The food they serve here is authentic indian vegetarian. Expect long queues on all days especially hindu festivals such as ugadi,0
ISKCON is really a wonderfull place to visit .Not only to the devotees of Lord Krishna it is a place of visit to every one as ISKCON is full of beautiful locations. If you are a devotee of Lord Krishna it looks like a paradise.,1
I went to iskcon temple with my friends. This is a historical place of lord Krishna. It is such a wonderful place and peaceful place,1
"Having a touch of South Indian temple architecture,this is such a grand temple complex.Situated near Yeswanthpur station,its a must visit attraction.",1
"Really impressive, overlooking the whole city, but very modern and a bit too commercial.
Still definitely worth a visit (remember that you'll have to climb the steps bare footed, so could be very slippery after rain)",1
It's a must visit Temple in Bangalore. Lovely atmosphere in and around.. Beautiful structure too. Just love to visit ISKCON !!,0
"I am religious but not a person who frequents temples. The visit to ISCKON temple took place due to my relatives, who were visiting and I actually enjoyed it. The place is well managed and organized to handle the huge amount of devotees right from the point of entry to exit. The environment inside is peaceful and we went back again to enjoy the Deepotsav festival, celebrated near to Diwali week where they turn down all the lights and pray with diyas and chants. It was an experience in itself.

There are shops in the floors below the temple which one has to visit on exiting. Contrary to many places, the shops are not all over-priced (I compared a few items with shops outside) and tourists can easily buy souvenirs and stuffs. Prasaad (Khichdi) is also served daily.",1
"ISKCON being one of the best temple which you will find in almost all the cities, is a go to place for blessings .The temple is well maintained.",1
"Located in Yeshwantpur, this place is a must visit if you are a believer in Almighty.

From entering the place till you finish the visit you immerse into a divine calmness of this Temple. You find people chanting Hare Rama Hare Krishna around the temple right feom the time you enter the temple. The Iskcon temple is beautifully architectured.

Photography is strictly not allowed inside the premises.

You find many shops inside the place alingwith snack bars which serve hot and tasty Jalebis (one of my fav).

For a tourist who is a non believer this might not appeal much but its a personal choice.

Parking is easily available as there is loads of space.

A must visit in Bengaluru.",1
"The temple is well organized from parking, shoe racks to q-line.
With rupees 300 ticket, you can watch the idols a bit closer and get the Pooja/archana done.
One is forced to walk pass through the stalls, mostly food items. Feels more like a commercial place",1
Its very big one... Best among i visited... Arati is must to be experienced. Divine environment. You will love it for sure.,1
Majestic.. lovely architecture. Beautiful is not the word ... it's something more than tat . Many shops inside to try a variety of veg Prasad's!!! Eggless pastries served here are the best .,1
"Been here a couple of times and had a good experience. Parking easily available for 2 and 4 wheelers at a fair rate. The queue is very organized and photography is not allowed inside the premises but Indian love breaking these rules. Entry is free and you need to deposit ur footwear near entry and can collect it post ur visit.
You get to see small Idols on the way before u get to the main shrine . People are always singing and dancing here Hare Rama Hare Krishna and you can sit around if you like and let the atmosphere sink into u. Just before the exit you will find yourself in a huge Hall area where you could buy things like toys, stationery , clothes etc . There are also a lot of food stalls that sell sweets and snacks a must try I would say, the samosa and jalebi are my favorites. Hope u have a good time , Hare Krishna.

A temple so huge and having such kind of population visiting everyday would leave any management in chaos. But looking at the professionalism of the the management here was a spectacular experience.,1
One of my favourite palace. I visit very often. This temple makes my mind cool and calm. I love to visit this place in bangalore.,1
"Once you are inside after security check up and keeping your shoes (Rs 2) it is very peaceful. First layer Narashima temple, 2nd layer, Tirupathi Srinivasa temple, finally Lord Krishna. Don't miss 108 steps for chanting Hare Krishna, also don't miss 7 PM arathi. There is free lunch if you are between 12 Noon and 3 Pm. Collect your free Prasad on the way out, along with photo of Lord Krishna in the language you want. Must visit",1
"Nice enough inside, good overall experience. Nothing special. I've been to other ISKCON temples that were more serene and relaxing where you could really feel the vibe a bit more. Nowhere to relax and enjoy the atmosphere, too busy and commercialised for me.",1
Beautiful temple..but lots of queue. Especially for shopping area..poor provision for handicapped and old aged people.,0
"Despite being the largest ISKCON in the country, this place fails to give you a peaceful mind mainly for what ISKCONS are famous for!!",1

Another one in the chain of ISCON temples. Very beautiful place with lot of space. And its location at some height adds to the attraction. One can have (good food) bhojan and bhajan at the same place. Must visit when in city of Gardens.,1
Excellent temple but too many stairs and poorly managed during rain and can be hazardous. Also needs wheel chair access to help all devotees get to the core temple!,1
"Iskon provides a beautiful spiritual ambience in heart of bangalore city. I went with my parents and wife , both loved the place. Also sm nice fine dining option is available inside the temple premises.",1

Something for all people of all religions and can be visited alone or with family.",1
"A group of vaishnava's have started a trust called hare Rama hare Krishna which has established ISKCON in various places in India. The temple is an finest example of art and delegance, but the trust is what makes it from calling it divine to somewhat an tourist spot. The only good factor is that people are allowed to have dharshan first and then they are made to go on an shopping spree. They are made to go through the shopping spot and are not allowed to break the line to exit. The worst thing is they sell everything like an bazaar and even for eatables u will get everything ranging from samosa's to puffs and even north indian. Annadanam is available for free at selected time intervals. There is also an hotel which is available during the temple hours.
The temple closes at 1PM and reopens at 4 PM and is available till 9 PM.
Do visit the place atleast once.",1
"it was a very nice trip, Temple is just awesome. i would recommend if any one is coming to Bangalore plz visit.",0
"It's good place everyone who are devotees
It's full of divine atmosphere chanting Hare krishna mantra while entering
Visit once ,then will like it",0
"Idols look awesome
Full peace
Darshan at night will be more good to look

earlier it was excellant, now a days it has become more commercial.",1
"The idols of Radha and Krishna are very beautiful and so are the paintings on the ceiling of the sanctum. If you are lucky, you can sit a bit and meditate. However, one does get a bit hungry after standing in the long line (an orderly line, but long) for darshan. There's great spread of food as soon as step out after darshan and the food is reasonably priced. Everything tastes great: lemon rice, malpua, pakodas. Yum! My favorite is the eggless wheat and jaggery cake. It is divine.
There's also a restaurant within the campus and the price in the al-a-carte menu are quite reasonable. If you choose to attack the buffet spread, ensure you have a big stomach and deep pockets. The buffet offers many dishes but it also comes at a steep price.",1
"""A must visit"" place for all those who live in Bangalore and for those who visit this city. This is the Abode of the Almighty of this Universe. Spic and span everywhere.",1
"Deserves a visit. One will come to know of the activities of ISKON. Well organized arrangements. Prasada is clean and hygienic and one can buy books, articles and other items related to Lord Krishna. The temple management serve food to schools, conduct spiritual activities and one can rent out halls for functions/weddings.",1
"This place is very calm and peaceful place. Well planned temple. Please visit temple evening time, it will very nice.",1
"o doubt that temple is excellent, food and prasad is owesome but I stopped going because ppls there force you to buy the things or for donation. These things should be from inside not by others.
If you can avoid it, you must visit. Their restaurant is also very good. MUST try.",1
Request you all to have a darshan of their Lordships whenever you visit to Bangalore. The spiritual experience is at the highest level and you will be more attached to their Lordships Sri Sri Radha Krishna Chandra. Dont forgot to have prasadam at the Temple.,1
When you visit BANGALORE you can visit this place. Connected to the city center by METRO SERVICE. preferably travel by metro to save time due to heavy traffic. approachable from AIR PORT BY road.,1
"Iskon is a Hindu temple mainly worships lord Krishna. It has well maintained facility with many charitable programs as part of the organization. One of which and most popular is Akshaya Patra. Iskon celebrates all Hindu festivals., with special events.",1
"The best experience is in the evening - be in the temple by 7:30 PM. There is an elaborate pooja & a colorful, lively and high-energy Palki Darshan, with people dancing and playing music - you can join in too.

Round this off with a great dinner at the excellent (if upmarket) restaurant in the complex, and this makes for a great outing as well.

There are lifts (escalators) for the physically challenged / lazy people. However this Temple is best enjoyed by fit people.",1
Good place in bangalore to seat for a long hour. I prefer to be here from morning 8 am onwards. Weekend is very much crowded,1
"There are no much places to visit in Bangalore City. But few places to visit in the city, one would be Iskon Temple. The architecture is beautiful and you can get free basic rice, sambar during lunch time. And close to the temple is the Orion mall.",0

Iskon temple visit is good but inside we won't feel like temple and complete artificial feeling and full commercial,0
"I have visited ISKON temple many times during my stay here. What I love is the way the crowds are organised. Every one gets a good darshan.
The other good part is that they have a nice food court set up in the premises and then the HIgher Taste which is amazing.
It is a good place to go to with family and friends.",1
"The atmosphere and cleaning with details make you feel total fulfilment with peace.
The Bhagat Gita works in books and CD were amazing . The Parsad is awesome. You just want to be sitting there for peace. Will like to visit again and again.

S K Bhargava",1
ISKCON temples always sooth you in a way of their own and Banglaore ISKON is no defferent. Its very nice place especially for Krishna's devotees.,1
"The temple is beautifully made. The height at which it is, offers a beautiful view and breeze. One feels peaceful. What I didnt like is that it has a lot of commercial element. On the way out, one has to pass through so many stalls. Even if one doesnt want to buy anything, you have to take the same route.",1
"It's a very Good Temple....
had gone wid friends..
A nyce place to Hangout wid frnds..
There is so much of devotion here..",0
"This is a must visit for temple lovers. I would recommend reach early i.e before 10 a.m if you would like to utilize the Iskcon parking.
You would need to deposit your footwear and buy passes before the darshan.
For elderly it is recommended to go for VIP passes, especially for folks with knee problems/ problems with climbing stairs.
Post Darshan, you will walk through their in house store - selling various goods like malas, gita, toys, clothes, eatables, pooja items and so on.
At exit you would be handed prasad (mostly halwa or khicdi) on leaf bowls. This is yummy.
Post all of this, you have option to go for free lunch (not that great, they serve rice, sambar, rasam, curd, one veg) or go for fine dining (@ Higher Taste Restaurant)
In short, it is a good place to spend half a day with your family.",0

"I have visited ISKON temple many times during my stay here. What I love is the way the crowds are organised. Every one gets a good darshan.
The other good part is that they have a nice food court set up in the premises and then the HIgher Taste which is amazing.
It is a good place to go to with family and friends.",1
"The atmosphere and cleaning with details make you feel total fulfilment with peace.
The Bhagat Gita works in books and CD were amazing . The Parsad is awesome. You just want to be sitting there for peace. Will like to visit again and again.

ISKCON temples always sooth you in a way of their own and Banglaore ISKON is no defferent. Its very nice place especially for Krishna's devotees.,1
"The temple is beautifully made. The height at which it is, offers a beautiful view and breeze. One feels peaceful. What I didnt like is that it has a lot of commercial element. On the way out, one has to pass through so many stalls. Even if one doesnt want to buy anything, you have to take the same route.",1
"It's a very Good Temple....
had gone wid friends..
A nyce place to Hangout wid frnds..
There is so much of devotion here..",1
"This is a must visit for temple lovers. I would recommend reach early i.e before 10 a.m if you would like to utilize the Iskcon parking.
You would need to deposit your footwear and buy passes before the darshan.
For elderly it is recommended to go for VIP passes, especially for folks with knee problems/ problems with climbing stairs.
Post Darshan, you will walk through their in house store - selling various goods like malas, gita, toys, clothes, eatables, pooja items and so on.
At exit you would be handed prasad (mostly halwa or khicdi) on leaf bowls. This is yummy.
Post all of this, you have option to go for free lunch (not that great, they serve rice, sambar, rasam, curd, one veg) or go for fine dining (@ Higher Taste Restaurant)
In short, it is a good place to spend half a day with your family.",1
I recommend this place to Every person....the joy and peace get here is not available any where..from small children to adults.all love this place ance they visit here...,1
"In Bangalore Iskcon temple is An amazing place with great ambiance and also since it is located on a hill the temperature is also very low and you can enjoy surrounding atmosphere very fresh and exciting, really well maintained and organized place i would say.",1
"I absolutely love this place, the vibes the scenes and the devotion and love for Lord Krishna, makes this place my favourite spot in Bangalore.",0
Its a usual temple same as the other part of country. The place is really good and gives you inner peace.,1

Calm Place....Visited with my family. One should must visit this place with their family in Bangalore.,1

Its beyond my expectation Its an amazing family trip for us. Its old and authentic and too mesmerizing experience for us,1
"People do come for darshan, but they have a great variations to have in cafeteria, i didnt like it imagine we get Pastries and Prasadam. Money Minded.",0
"A temple that is well catered for tourists. Good security, clean and well maintained. Good facilities to keep your shoes safe whilst inside the Temple. Can get bit tricky on a wet day.",1
"I love the chant of ""Hare krishna"" going on in the backgound. I would recommend not to go there on a weekend or a festival because then there is too much crowd. Once you finish your 108 chanting on the way to the main shrine then you can go to the amphitheatre to know more about Krishna or head to the cafeteria and eat some really good satvik food. Cost for 2 is about 500. you can also purchase prayer beads or books or souvenirs to give people from their in house store. Also on sale is the prasad(coconut barfi being my personal favorite).",0
"The atmosphere transports us to the spiritual realm just with the purity in the environment. It has cleanliness, hygiene, friendly inmates, delicious delicacies and soul stirring praises of Lord Krishna.",0
beautiful place to visit. beautifully maintained and managed. food is okay. all the services provided by the authority is good and with the number of people visiting is acceptable. little of showbiz.,0
"I've visited this temple, around 7 years back. Wanted to visit this again for quite some time now, which came true last week. Such peace here. The aarti time is the best. The food is too good in the temple.",1
It's one of the great place to go visit in Banglore.. Very good for outdoor photography but not inside the temple... You can't take anything inside the main temple.. But it's worth visiting this place,1
"I had been with my colleague to this place.
The temple and its premises are very clean.
Crowded but this place is good to be.",1
Nice place to visit on a weekend which can combine both religious and attractions. I went along with parents & kids and both had something to look forward for.,1
"Nice well maintained temple. Very systematic.. went there with family. there was no problem finding parking. since it was festival season there was lot of crowd. after standing in queue for about 10-15 min we could reach the main temple hall. There was Deepotsav going on where you can buy small panathi (lamps) and burn them there itself. There are big statues of ram sita in the hall. after you exit the main hall, there are other rooms where lot of books, pictures and other pooja items are placed for display and also available for sale. once you come out of the temple you can collect the prasaad (which usually is pongal) and exit the temple. Overall very peaceful place and must visit in bangalore...",1
"ISKON temple Bangalore is situated in the centre of the city accessible easily from any location. The three tier temples dedicated to Lord Krishna in different avatars is a must see while visiting Bangalore. True to its identity, it is very clean, neat and divine. Piped music of melodious 'hare krishna hare ram' fills your ears and soul, stops your thoughts from wandering.

Restaurants(2 of them) and mini shopping arcade are well stacked and economical. We had even conducted a family function in their mini hall. Catering arranged by ISKON was good. You can contribute to' Akshaya Patra' meal scheme for children.A scenic beauty and a tourist attraction with the blessings of Lord Krishna. What more can you ask for!!!",1
Very good place to visit. Calm atmosphere. Worth visiting. You need to deposit your shoes before entering the main premises. Usually very crowded on weekends.,1
I Love to be here. Loads of peace and the environment is very very good. But the Shopping here is a bit expensive though!,1
I have been a spiritual tourist coming to India for 50 years. Well worth to visit this (or any other) ISKCON center. the food (prasadam) is excellent.,0
Nice architecture though it is a modern day temple. Lots of shopping after the darshan on the way out.,1
"best place for lord krishna devotees and there is bajans will be performed, you can get blessings form lord kirshna",1
This is a lord Krishna and radha temple. It is much crowded by high rise buildings. There are many statues of lord Krishna and goddess radha. In the temple there are many stalls pertaining to God Krishna and goddess radha and also of sweets and snacks. The Prasad offers there was very delicious. It's a must visit place while you are in Bengaluru.,0
One of the best places to devote Ur chilling evenings to on a fine weekend. Beautiful Radha Krishna sculptures and murtis. A must go fr a Bangalore visited person,1
Perfect place for Peaceful day. Well built temple in bangalore and one must visit. Well managed administration.There is also prasadam and also lunch offered by temple.,0
"Beautiful and very clean temple. you will find this place very peaceful in mid of noisy city.
Lots of souvenirs available for purchase with huge variety of eatables too at exit point. Prasad which was given at exit is really tasty and we enjoyed a lot.",1
"Nice temple to have peaceful mind.
Very well maintained. Very clean environment. Facilities are good. Food quality in shops also good.",1
"Iskcon temples are available in almost all the major cities, Bengaluru being no exception. It is on the outskirts of the city on a hillock. The temple has adequate parking facility which is rarely found in Bengaluru and this added a sigh of relief to me. The premises absolutely neat and clean with staff maintaining the standards continuously. The worship place may appear a bit crowded but he people maintained order and silence. The main altar was in a well illuminated and a decorated hall which had big beautiful paintings drawn on the walls and the ceiling. The idol of Lord Radha Krishna was mesmerizing people sit a while after the Darshan for chanting the slokhas. With the Mangala Arthi starting at 4 am there are many pujas conducted during the day and the Shayana arthi being the last ritual of the day at 8pm. From the temple one can see the spectacular view of the surrounding landscapes and buildings of the city. There are literature books available in a variety of languages at the exhibition hall including plethora of artifacts. At the end of the darshan, prasad which is food a devotional offering is distributed among the devotees. It is must visit place in bangalore you must not miss.",1

Lovely place for family very good temple and very testy prasad in temple. Temple is on hill very good view,1
My god I love Lord Krishna's temple because he is my soul god and ISKCON is super place for devotion for all people. I was very glad to see see many avatars of Lord Vishnu in this temple and I often visits this temple and it is good I mean really good,1
"This is genuinely a divine place to visit if anyone wants to find peace. They provide a ""bhog"" i.e. ""Khichdi"" as prasad which hygienic and very tasty as well. I would recommend to give it a visit.",1
"Its is one of the most beautiful structure's of the iskcon temple, spread out well with a great height ,it s a tribute to all of iskcon temple for its grandeur and beauty , Its composes of such majestic beauty with a spirit of joy, beauty ,peace and love.visiting the temple is a treat to one s soul, with its fantastic indian vegetarian restaurant is a must .",1
"This temple is beautiful. The only issue is with the stalls selling books and merchandise. The moment you exit the sanctum sanctorum, you are assailed by those stalls. It is also a safety risk in my view as it makes the exit very crowded and leads to a lot of pushing and shoving.

Moreover , there are 2 dedicated floors for shopping and a full fleged food court. Hence it would be better if they dismantled the stalls near the immediate exit of the mail temple.",1
An uber temple of lord Krishna...is a grt outing place in quest of spiritual quotient....huge temple great maintenance are bench mark,1
"May month, we visited the temple with our foreign collogues. Yes it was very beautiful and clean temple. The main part is organizing by management team was wonderful. If you have time you should visit the place . Very calm and best place for relax your mind /body and soul.",1
A very ice built and maintained Temple. They serve free prasadam in the evenings to hundreds of devotees.,1
Amazing architecture. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Bangalore. Looks good in Night. Five stars.,1
Visit will not disappoint you of what you have read or heard. One should surely try here although distance may be a cause.,1
"This temple is well known among the devotees of Krishna. Has been maintained well and neat. Crowded almost anytime of the day.
Also to note is the huge line up of decent food stalls while coming out after darshan. The khichdi served as prasad is quite nice too.",1
"Looks great, especially at night with all the lighting on the grand structure of the temple. Can get exhausting climbing all the way up and down though. No distinct religious feel to the place as such though.",1
"This is located in Yeshwantpur, Bangalore. The temple is a beautiful white structure in a captivating surrounding. The temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna. We visited during the evening hours and attended the aarti. It was great experience to be in the mass aarti session witnessing devotees praying to the Lord, singing the bhajans and dancing. The temple environment was very peaceful. I felt peace in my mind by spending some time in the temple premises.",1
you can visit the temple to get some peace of ind. the place is calm and beautiful. The huge structure is definittely worth a visit,1
It was a lovely serene atmosphere and in spite so many people well organised to have darshan. The one way system of in and out helped manage the crowds.,1
This is the very good temple to see in mahalakshmi lay out in bangalore . this is the maim attractive place in bangalore . I have visited this place yesterday I usually go to this place often and often .this is the temple of krishna . this temple,1
"I don't feel like it is a temple. I felt like a ""forced to visit"" supermarket. Too much sales. Even snacks.. And sadly I saw a dialogue written new free food area that ""if you want to avoid war then believe in Krishna"" I have no idea what they means with that..",0
Beautiful temple located in the heart of bengaluru. Neatly maintained with ample car parking. The best way of dharshan on a crowded day is to buy a ticket for Rs.200 for which we get into a special entrance with archana before three deities along with prasadam and a religious book (all languages)worth Rs.75/- absolutely free.,0
"A good scenic place in the heart of the city, depicts the Indian Culture, free prasadhams( food) help the needy and poor, variety of gifts to purchase, some place to show the guests... but do we really get the temple feeling. The religious rituals probably are missing. A few contradictory activities ( onions as prasadhams), keeping God as a show idle etc., does not create a feeling of a place of worship. At times, fear of God controls our behaviour, makes us disciplined. I would call it more a religious place than a temple- if we compare it with Thirupathi balaji temple or the Mahalakshmi Layout Anjeneya Temple which is just opposite ISKON.",1
"in the center of city , the temple's architecture is good, huge and a combination or modern and southindian architecture.
- Should visit in proper cloths (avoid modern cloths)
- spent some time there , its peaceful
- can buy various stuff related to krishna
- prasad is delicious",1

A Temple that you have to visit and experience the positivity! Its beautiful...The food served inside is also a must try!,1
"The temple is on a small hilltop and the premises span across a vast area but is maintained very well. Everything is in order and there is no rush. We went on a Saturday afternoon, there was less crowd and had a very good darshan of the Almighty. After the darshan we got piping hot kichdi as bhog prasad. There are also several counters selling lots of sweet and savouries.",1
"There is something about this place, the purity , the essence of the place and the feeling with which you back. It is really worth spending an evening here with the heavenly touch.",1
This place was really serene and peaceful. And the view of this temple at night is really nice. Best time to visit this temple is in evening when they light the lamps inside the temple .,1
"This temple is surely not for a non-beleiver. We went there in the evening, but we were not able to visit the temple without participating a crowdy ""pooja"". It is not a good practice, if the temple is for all kinds of visitors.",0
We spent an afternoon walking through the temple and just soaking it all in. Everyone was very welcoming and inclusive disputed the fact that we were clearly there to see the temple as tourists. It was an amazing experience in a very unique place.,1
The ISKCON is an iconic temple in itself. The one in Bangalore especially is special due to its sheer size and number of visitors it get everyday. Really beautiful from the inside.,1
"Temple and maintenance is too good. Idols in the temple are beautiful. Can spend some time in the premises of temple for peace of mind. Many shops selling food, prasadam, pooja articles etc in ground floor of temple.",1
"I personally feel Iskcon temple has been commercialized. At every nook and corner, you can find people selling some or the other stuff. It is a majestic place. Good for walking and shopping. But if you want peace of mind and be with lord Krishna, I would not suggest this place.",1
"we had visited mumbai eskon..compared to mumbai this is very well maintained, opened in different time.
please do visit bangalore iskon if you are in garden city.
Bus routes - BUS NO 402,308, OR ANY BUS which routes through yespuntpur and west-of-cord road",1
"very beautifully made place, i visited here on Saturday night & the crowd was less & i also liked the khichdi they gave as a prasad, it was so delicious in taste",1
The temple's atmosphere is divine and outstanding. Arrangement is very good. Normally not too much rush to get darshan.,1
Its a rich temple. Building is beautiful and big. Place is very calm and religious. Some shops/cafeteria are also there. Overall can/must be visited if in Bengaluru depending on religious orientation.,0
"hare krishna hare rama !hare hare!
this is just like the ISKON in Juhu Mumbai,but this is magnificiently maintained and darshan is hassle free. Men cannot enter in 3/4ths and have to wear a mundu if they have to get the darshan.
wonderful experience.",1
"I visited many iskcon temples in india but this one was different. South indian style temple carvings and design, beautifully made. Clean and organised. Definitely a must visit place of bangalore.",1
"This feel very much like a Hindu temple theme park, commercial undertaking for tourists - save your time and visit some authentic places instead.",1
"It is a nice, big well maintained premises with well behaved volunteers and very pleasant atmosphere..although one should avoid certain days when crowds are heavy and one doesnt have to stand in long queues.
The overall system for crowd management and prasadam is also very organized. With reference to the building, the glass on the 'shikhar' seems out of place..but the overall environment in the premises is spiritually enriching..surely worth a visit!!",1
This is an excellent place to pray Lord Krishna. Very well organised hassle-free Darshan. Evening darshan will be much more fantastic as we can view krishna devotees dancing to the rythamic tunes. I love to stay & spend long time at this place always.One more thing the great prasad of Krishna....,1
"This ISKCON temple is a very beautiful temple among others located in bangalore. It is a must visit for people who come to visit bangalore and go sightseeing. One can come here easily by local cabs, or local buses or even metro train. Try to visit during Aarti time to completely enjoy the atmosphere and feel blessed. Also there is a very nice restaurant serving various prasadams. There is a mini theatre for kids showing Krishna movie for 20 minutes. Also there is a nice gift gallery where one can buy souvenirs.
You can also visit other beautiful temples in the surroundings like Hanuman temple and the temple of Lord Venkateshwara.
One can expect some crowd and queue during Sundays and holidays. Time required to visit is like minimum one hour.",0
Worth visiting. A spiritual atmosphere prevails in and around the temple. The temple is on the top of a small hillock. A vaisnavite temple. On the west of chord road. Visit to the temple definitely will linger in your mind for a long time.,1

There are lot of things inside available like museum about Krishna, souvenir shops,bakery items without onion and garlic.

This is nearby yeshwantpur, majestic railway and bus station.",1
"I have visited Iskcon temple many times with my family & friends. This temple is really beautiful and especially in evening when all the lights are put on. The premises was maintained very well and felt relaxed in the divine atmosphere. There are many stalls selling idols, bhagavad gita, sweets, etc on the way out, if you want you can purchase them while returning.

Overall a beautiful place to visit",1
While exiting you feel like you are in a supermarket selling all kind of stuff or disneyland where for all rides you have to get out through a shop.,1
Ok to visit once. Place is good. Nice location.Seat there enjoy the chants. many stalls are there.over fine.,1
It is one of the most beautiful temple in india. ALl bhakt can be seen dancing and enjoying.Nice to go at least once.,1

7. Delicious food at reasonable price",1
"This krishna temple is lanmark place for the surrounding area. From the entry to exit quite organised well. First a normal checkup in gate, then bag your slippers and walk in the queue for sometime and you will reach the main hall of the temple, you can the lords in the sanctum.

You can sit and listen the Bajan for sometime. Then while coming out you can see the Book stalls, sweet stalls and some religious items to buy. Get the prashadam and you are on your way out. In noon you can anna dhana.

A good temple for good experience.",1

"I have visited Iskcon temple many times with my family & friends. This temple is really beautiful and especially in evening when all the lights are put on. The premises was maintained very well and felt relaxed in the divine atmosphere. There are many stalls selling idols, bhagavad gita, sweets, etc on the way out, if you want you can purchase them while returning.

Overall a beautiful place to visit",1

"very beautiful temple, good architecture, nice idols of god sree krishna, very big temple, must see in benguluru, we spent more than two hours, they also provides lunch at free of cost for piligrims.",1
"Located in the centre of the city, it can be reached comfortably by the newly added metro apart from other conveyance. There is ample parking arrangement made for private vehicles. The shrine though on a small hillock is reachable comfortably. The Lord Srinivasa & Sri Narasimha archa murthis are devine to look at and your bhakthi is sure to be enunciated. The systematic arrangement for darshan of the lord adds to your comfort. The large prayer hall at Sri Krishna shrine makes you feel the presence of the supreme power. Books on Hindu epics and related subjects is available in almost all the major Indian languages & English. Articles & mementos are in plenty for your collection. Apart from the shops selling hygienic snacks two class vegetarian restaurants are also available, The animated shows are a must see, The service of volunteers is exemplary. On Festival days special arrangements are made with at most care for easy flow of the devotees.
A must visit in Bangalore.",1
A place where you can actually see your soul dancing to the tunes of Hare Krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare.... its amazing to see the feeling of eternal peace dawn on you while chanting the above mantra and your soul and heart just feel the lightness and you feel not ever you should go back to worldly affairs.... a place just for type of people who want peace and serenity in their life at least for some time....,1
"Very well maintained place. Would not be a place of worship but a must visit tourist spot. On top of hill, it gives a splendid view of Bangalore city. Better time to visit is early evening so that one gets time to enjoy the sunset too.",1
"Whenever you visit any ISKCON Temple make sure you'll have organized worshiping experience, I see it as Icon of luxury devotion and reverence. If you are not a believer then perhaps this isn't for you. Marvel floors, granite walls, no long queue, and elevators are some of the USP that keeps ISKCON Temple different from other Temples that you visit in and around India. The 7PM aarti is an awesome experience and you must visit for sure, learn few lines in Sanskrit to make sure you are in the tune, you will feel the connect too. For old age and knee issues, they have an elevator. Prasada and Bhog are also distributed but I feel it should be of better quality. They have a small shopping and eatery outlet but the quality of food/snacks is not good at all, so avoid those outlets within the campus, ie. the food stalls at the ground floor.",1
Beautiful architecture and personnel. A little surprised about the bare foot policy but I liked it after a few steps inside.,1
Beautiful temple. Very nice temple to visit in Bangalore. Artwork was excellent. Worthy visit. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna. Very excellent view.,0
"The Iskcon temple is a majestic series of imposing buildings located on a hill, In these clean surroundings, there is no pressure to participate in religious ceremonies. I was interested in visiting their famous kitchens where nutritious vegetarian meals are cooked and despatched for thousands of school children,orphanages, senior citizens and prisoners. One can sample these meals in the various canteens. including delicious cakes and pastries -all egg free. It was a short visit but they also celebrate many festivals with dances in evening performances. Their programme is inspiring and secular. Ask for someone t o show you around",1
"I visited the temple with my parents. This is a great place to visit with family if you have even a slightly religious bent of mind.
The only complain about this place is the degree of commercialisation done in the name of religion. Made me feel like I have entered a mall at times.",1
Last Year end oktober i visited this big tempel.. witha collegea after work. We were not aware that at that evening The festival of light was starting so we were overwhellemed for me iT was The first time in Bangalore an lot of impressions . Although it might be a bit commercial it give you a bit of India culture to just do it when you are here for a business trip,1
"Go there regularly with the family. The sanctum sanctorum is peaceful and after your Darshan, you can sit down and admire the artwork on the ceiling and take in the grandeur of the temple.

Once the Darshan is complete, you can go to the 3d theatre if you have children.",1
"I had visited the one at Mayapur , West Bengal. Had visited this temple number of times. If we take the commercial part out, two words Peace Inside",1
"This temple is really great to visit late evenings. Easy to access - on Chord Road. View from the temple is excellent as it is on a hill. Temple precinct is extremely clean and well-kept. Very popular and crowded during major festivals, especially Krishnashtami. Food at the restaurant is very good.",1
"Its a nice place to have your peace of mind with your family, we really enjoyed the one day when we went to the place, you can really feel peace from the corner of the heart, as it is little far from the city, its better if you will start in the early of the morning.",1
"Neo Temple with airconditioning and all the modern amenities, a nice place for meditation and lots of yummy prasad on the offering,
one can take home a lot of hindu culture and all.",1
"From a beauty aspect- nil.
In terms of interesting and informative value- nil.
If you have visited anything outside your own culture ever, this will fall short of that.
Just very bland, it's not old, not beautiful, not even clear what it is or why.",1
I visited this 5-6 times till now with family/friends. Its an awesome place and can visit any number of times. Gold krishna idols are eye catching. Its very near yeswanthapur railway station.,1
"Religious, spiritual and peace of mind; Donate generously for good work; God bless and beneficiaries out of Akshayapatra wishes good for all of us.",1
"Without a doubt, this is one of the biggest temples in Bangalore. Its inside environment makes you fall in love with this place. All kinds of Indian sweets are available inside this temple. A very large conventional hall is availble inside temple premises for all marriage functions. Parking is provided for two wheelers and four wheelers. If you are visiting Bangalore, you should definitely visit this place.",1
"The temple is good looking, with proper management of things. The area is clean, but There is a section, which is commercial shopping centers, The shops offers you variety of thing related to ISKON like t shirts, posters, paintings, medicines, religious products etc. Another section of temple is a big canteen providing you with bakery products, drinks, ice creams.",1
One of the best architecture among country's best temple. So silent and serene.....visit the place for recreation fun and peace of mind,1
"It's more commercial place with wedding halls, mall than temple. It's more north Indian style gods, not as south.",1
The Temple is a very interesting visit for someone of another faith. It is a beautiful place. Everyone can learn from this experience.,1
"Not suggestible for public holidays as it will be quite crowded. It is a nice temple, but few areas are much commercialized.",1
"Its a good temple, don't forget you use long trouser and cover shoulders, otherwise they make you use a toga, also you have go barefoot.
After a bit of stairs, you can see the temple its great. Afterwards its like a fair, a bit too commercial for me.",1
"The inner part of the temple gives awesome ambience. But just to see that we are supposed to stand in queue and follow the marching orders given by staff around as such to primary kids. Additionally photography is prohibited at those places we feel to take a pic. Aftermath the visit in the temple the later part is occupied by hawkers and vendors who persuade you for purchasing their stuff, giving the place a market effect. Cafeteria is also there . All in all the place is good but rules are strict .",1
"Must go and see this peaceful place in Bangalore very Natural and best temple.
The are was very clean and parking facility was there and inside Prasadam also very nutritious and must eat food here.",1
"No word's to say

Simply Awesome

Me & my friends enjoyed a lot in load Krishna temple.

I'm happy to say

Jai Krishna",0
"Arguably one of the most beautiful of modern Hindu temples. The area is clean, parking is taken care of, arrangements are good & atmosphere is full of piety. Another must visit places in Bangalore.",1
"Best Temple to visit in bangalore!!!!
I have visited this temple 03 time n yet to visit next time also.",1
"I enjoyed the mistic and devotion of all the visitors , I learned a good deal about his religion. I would recommend it",0
Excellent temple. Must visit. Krishna idol was excellent. Had magnificent fountain also. They also have shops to attain spiritual knowledge.,1
"The hype of standing in queues that resemble Tirupati is avoidable. The gift shops are a hard sell. As a visitor to the temple, you are forced to visit every stall that sells wares and this is not so wonderful!
Keep it reverential and don't make it a money-spinning industry. The look and feel of a ISKCON Temple is missing. The place is clean and the temple area is very nice.",0
I am not a hindu but than too though to visit and its very well maintained even the enter line lost of people to help good one,1
"If you are a Hindu or interested in Hinduism, this place will definitely not disappoint you. Its peaceful and serene. The minute you enter the main prayer hall on top of the peak, you feel like you are in a different world when you see the gods. Its a must visit place! You also get piping hot prasad every day and lots of sweets, snacks and stuff to buy.",1
"One of ecstatic landmarks in Bengaluru. Have visited multiple times, but first visit years back always is on top of mind.

During visit to Narasimha temple, the first one which comes on the way, there were more than 30-40 steps , which we have to cross, one step at a time, during which we have to chant HARE KRISHNA. Still can feel that positive vibrations, it can bring to mind. Still perplexed from those memories.

Following must
1. Feel free to say Hare Krishna etc loudly along with crowd.
2. Take time to sit down n meditate with silence.
3.Don't miss Prasada/lunch/dinner, which is served at reasonable cost.

Me, may not be a God believer, but won't oppose any religious beliefs. Just take it as concept to bring several People n minds together.

To conclude, several buildings are coming up in and around this landmark, which may lose its shine. Better to visit on weekday, when it's less crowded.",1
"Good place for an evening outing with friends and family.
Kids may also enjoy. Ideals are north india style.

Recently it is been turned into a business place, too many shops, which has to be mandatory passed through.

One veg restaurant is very good. Free prasada is very tasty and good.",0
"I have a long ""acquaintance"" with the Hare Krishna movement ISKON, which started in the London of the sixties, when I had the chance to meet personally Prabhupad Baktivedanta Swami.
This temple is beautiful, on a hill overlooking the town, kept very clean and beautifully organized, both qualities I don't often find in Indian temples.
Maybe this high level organization is a bit against spirituality, but when I finally was in the central room, with devotees chanting, music, and the lifesize statue of Prabhupad, the beautiful paintings on the ceiling, and the statues of Krishna and Radha, I felt back memories and feelings of high spirituality.
Consider that my spiritual name Manohar is one of the names of Krishna, and you can understand how I felt in a state of bliss...",0
iskcon followers can not stay away from iskcon followers and temples.this was my first visit to iskcon temple in bangalore.,1
Fantastic architecture and grand interiors in main Lord Krishna sanctum.If you are Shri Krishna devotee then you should probably visit this place.Spend some time in main sanctum of Lord Krishna to attain inner peace .Place is well maintained by management . Very clean and tidy. Hare Krishna Hare Rama ! Long live Hindutva,1
"I visited in Sep 2016. The Place is very clean and calm. Nice huge campus and activities are well managed with clear markings and workers guiding you. Only thing that looked odd was it is too much commerciallized. Vendors selling books /CDs etc...right inside the temple was a bit odd. After you exit the main hall, again lots of shops await you right in side the campus only , where you have to shell out big money for everything you buy. Even for Prasadam, you have to buy it from the shop. Only free thing that you get there is a small portion of Khichri ! I think inside a religious place, they should provide free meals.",1
"I visit this place quite often as an escort to my relatives who come to visit Bangalore. Now this place looks to me more of a commercial place than a temple with money coming at every point. I prefer a small temple with quietness rather than a big one with lots of noise and where you are just shoved around or where you have to pay extra for special darshan. You get varieties of things to eat and buy here which you may like but otherwise, it remains as just another place of visit in Bangalore",0
"ISKCON is a society earning lots of money with spirituality.
The ISKCON Temple is open for visits, that's true. Visitors - not members - are forced through a path leading to a few highlights of the temple but much more through all the selling places. They make you to pass their book-selling places, they make you walk through the selling places for touristic stuff, they make you walk through the shops were they sell everything from their own books to all the stuff, tourists might like. You are not allowed to take pictures, you are not allowed to spend some time away from these paths, you are not allowed to use short cuts to avoid their shops. They ask you to pay, pay pay or to become a member (at least, if you are willing to pay again).
In normal temples you are free to visit - sometimes you are not allowed to the inner, holy parts, which is ok, but generally you can just go there and move freely, go here and there, have a look, take part in a puja if you like, do not so, if you don't want. In normal temples, you can visit the shops situated there, if you don*t want, leave them out.
In ISKCON Temple you are forced especially into the stores, the religion, the spiritual parts are not important, they don't really want you there, but they want you wherever they can get your money.
If you can visit other temples in Bangalore or in the surroundings of Bangalore, do so and do not waste your time in this mall called 'temple'.
If you are there, make sure to have some time to visit the washing place next to the temple where you can see the Indian reality of poeple do the washing for hotels, private people, Offices etc, which lies direct next to the temple. A visit is free and the people over there are happy if you look around, spend some time, speak to them, take a few pictures with the children over there. Nobody asks for your money, you feel welcomed, even if the people there are poor.
In the temple we felt reduced to our money, in the washing place next door we felt real people.",1
"Perfect place to go when visiting India and have to show something to colleagues. Loud, crowdy (mostly), colorful and looks exactly as we in Europe expect a temple to be",1
It is one of the famous Krishna temple in bangalore which is situated in West of Chord road. It is located on a small Hill. The place is well maintained by the temple management.First we have Darsham of Lord Narasimha then of Lord Venkateshwara (Balaji) & finally the main sanctum of Lord Krishna with Lord Bala ramesh & with goddesses radha & rukmini devi.,1
"Ohh what a pleasant experience to see this mesmerising ISKCON temple. Fantastic architecture and grand interiors of the main hall.

Never miss to visit ISKCON Temple when visiting Bangalore.",1
"Very nice place , Place is well maintained.Very clean,very pleasant specially in the evening.Too good Darshan",1
"ISKCON temples are known for their rich and beautiful designs and this one does complete justice to this. Perched at a decent height, it gives a magnificent view of Bengaluru skyline. Enter the temple through the massive yet beautiful door and you have entered a beautiful land with golden chariots and a gorgeous ceiling painted with Krishna's life stages. Beware, the temple is crowded at all times and closes its door at specific times(which I don't remember currently).",1
"A Few years back, we visited ISKCON temple in the evening - spent more than an hour in the Q! Our Second visit was abandoned as there was too much of Crowd as it was on a Janmashtami.

This time we visited the temple at 07.30 AM and there was hardly any crowd and no Q! We had Darshan in less than 10 minutes. We could sit there for some time and pray peacefully. We also had darshan of Laxmi Narasimha swami, Balaji and Hanuman.

The premises are well maintained with hardly any dust.
Worth visiting any number of times!",1
"This is a magnificent structure devoted to Lord Krishna. The atmosphere is spiritual and peaceful.In case you are not religious,you should still see this place for the elegance,efficiency,professionalism and the clock work precision with which they do things.

They have a food court and sort of a mall area,where you get literature on Lord Krishna and Indian Mythology/Religion.The food here is very tasty and very reasonably priced
They also run a meal scheme for government school students named""Akshay Patra"" and strongly recommend that you make contribution for this noble service",1
"Even if you are not religious this is a must place to see, so clean, so systematic and perfect. You will forget where you are and will dissolve in the bliss of devotion to the Supreme Lord.",1
"Though this is a gigantic construction, maintained excellently there is no speciality to this temple or place as per mythology. But daily several prayers, pinas etc rituals are being done here systematically, the place/temple gets power. Though the darshanam is free to all, there is a sewa ticket also costs 300 for 6 persons by which we can have a closer darshanam of lord narasimha, lord tirupati balaji and lord sri krishna and At krishna mandir sankalpam, puja, aarti will be given . The ticket holders gets prasadam and books of choice language also freely. Animation show at cost is also available. Several puja items and food items are also available for sale . Worth seeing .",1
A temple should not be profit oriented. It should be peaceful and should let the devotees concentrate more on prayer.,1
A very nice place for Lord Krishna devotees. Marvelous architecture. You can buy awesome souvenirs & spiritual books from the temple,1
"If one is very religious than worth the visit, quite famous though, you' can find lots of activity there",1
"Iskon temple in Bangalore is very nice place to visit for the tourist, don't miss when you are in Bangalore",1
"We found the temple beautiful and felt spiritual visiting!

Had the chance of participating in a blessing service but changed our mind and got up to go. This felt a bit like an international incident as we had to wait to be allowed out.

Not sure what ticket we were sold but we were given a bag with some items and food inside.

Then as you exit the selling part for their books takes place rather interesting experiencing this but I guess they rely on generating funds for this beautiful building which has a lot of gold to upkeep

Then you finally exit through a number of stalls in a gift shop!

It's worth a visit even though the traffic to go anywhere is so busy. We were given clothing to cover our ankles and also shoulders need covered, you get money back that you leave to borrow these items",1
ISKCON temple is built in an ornate architectural style.It is a temple which is a blend of modern technology and spiritual harmony.It is always full of devotees.,1
Very Beautiful Temple and great view. The temple is generally very crowded during weekends. The Prasad given to each bhakt is very tasty.,0
A beautiful structure which has a very positive environment. A good place to get some time out of the city hustle bustle.,1
It is one of famous places of Bangalore. It is located in middle of the city and easily accessible by metro or bus. Temple is very clean and we can spend almost 2 hours there.,1
"Very good place to see who have faith in god.
Radhe krishna and lord venkateswara temple in upstairs were good. Shopping area inside the temple will give you affordable price for buying spiritual things.

Canteen and sweets are very neat and good taste. Prasadham near exit is awesome.",1
A must visit in Bengaluru and best place for lord Krishna devotees.This temple is really beautiful. Specially in evening when all the lights are put on!,1
Visit even if you aren't a religious person. One of the most peaceful places to visit in Bangalore. Do try to visit during the last maha mangalarthi in the evening. Best spiritual experience ever.,0

It is one of the must visit place in Bangalore. This temple is really beautiful. Specially in evening when all the lighths are put on!,1

"We went last week. I didn't expect to see so much people.
It was very peaceful and divine visit.It is easily reachable through metro.

It had good collection of books in all languages.",1
"For Local people best and worth time to visit on regular days Early Morning and late evening i.e Last aarthi time. I would Recommend don visit on festival times, its very rush and you feel irritate.
Many people complains about commercial sections while in exist because of more out side travelers.",1
"Situated at vantage point giving a fair birds eye view increasingly being blocked by multistory buildings coming up in the vicinity. Three entrance's Main one is grand but, during the day majestic flight of stairs turn so hot... Second one is covered but, one has to pass through Zig-Zag market per force... Third one is a lift that lands directly to Temple floor but, no one will tell you and even if you discover they make various excuses to...

The Idols of the presiding Deity are Grand so are other graffiti, beyond doubt an unique experience in one's own perspective.",1
"Decent place but expensive to visit considering this is a Temple, not sure why we was charged so much, the temple itself is nice but i wasnt keen on the fact we was forced upon to watch certain ceremonies, i think this should be based on the persons own interested. Otherwise still worth the visit.",1
"Visit this Radhe-Krishna temple with your spouse and spend good time inside being silent and looking around..

Avoid going single or with a group. Then, you'll not understand the significance of the temple.",0
"We used to go there and sit for long times during college days. But now, it looks more like a shop and there's no difference between this temple and other temples in the vicinity. Everyone is trying to sell something! Didn't like!",1
"We are regular visitors to ISKCON and this time it was a special occasion - starting of Damodara month on 16th Oct '16. We offered 'deepa' (ghee lamp) to the Lord.

It's one of the very beautiful ISKCON temples built around the world and it is a 'must visit' place of worship. Even non-believers of God will get attracted once you are there! One can visit anytime of the year and visiting timings can be checked from their web site. This place can be of 'half day trip' since it has so much to offer to the visitor - shopping area with variety of pooja items, quick food restaurant and also an excellent & luxurious 'The Higher Taste' restaurant.",1
"The location, ambience and the devotional fervour of devotees make this place very unique in bangalore. The pallaki utsav is a wonderful event conducted on a daily basis. This is a must participate event in iskcon. The prasad that is served to the devotees after this utsav is very tasty. In short iskcon visit in the evening post 6 pm is a treat for the soul and stomach and to the eyes",1
"Very very superb place to start in the weekend. Such a great and huge size temple in Bangalore, our legs will cry to walk inside the temple.Very very beautiful and calm @barea to watch this temple. All should have a visit at least once in our lives. So marvelous and excellent place to see in our life.",0
I visited here with my family. Very nice temple and have darshan of lord shi radhakrishna. I really love this place.,1
"The Bangalore ISKCON temple is truly a piece of peace amidst the Silicon Valley .. The hectic lifestyle of the young generation weather working or studying in Bangalore, desperately need the serenity and austere surrounding of such temple within the city, cause all other famous temples are at least one night journey out of town.. At the same time the beautiful architecture and view is a definite crowd puller for both tourists and locals alike.. Don't forget to dine at The Higher Taste Multicuisine restaurant, where they serve Bhog Prasad, which is not only Higher in taste but the decor and ambience can give 5 star hotels and restaurants a run for their money! My humble request, if you're in Bangalore, a visit to Iskcon temple is a must..",1
"We visited it during our city tour of Bangaluru. It is at good location. As it is at some height, we loved to indulge in cool breeze. We felt relaxed in the divine atmosphere.
The Prasad of Khichadi was awesome! Don't miss.",1

Please chant..
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare!
Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare!!
...and be happy üòä",1
"The temple is nicely maintained with lots of parking places. Yes you have to go through a big queue but once you reach the main temple once will definitely like the place. The only thing is that while returning they make you pass through lots of shopping area and with the ladies with you, one ends up spending some amount there on shopping. The food etc available there is really good.",1
"Iskon Temple is fabulously maintained. Built in the 90's, it's pretty new as far as temples go. It gets full marks on cleanliness and the structure is quite imposing.
ISKON in general, with it's new-age take on Krishna has a fairly thought out commercial element to it too, with a cafeteria and shopping section. The food is great though!",1
"Love this place, worth visiting. I admire the support programs offered by the temple management to the under privileged children.
Visiting the temple and praying and meditating was a better experience when there wasnt much traffic around the locality.
I only wish the temple made sure the people who visit are quiet and respect the time and space of other devotees.
Temples are meant to be a non-chaotic peaceful place for an individual to find himself and God. Respecting their time and space is important.",1
Overall a good temple and quiet place to visit. Must visit at least once if going to nearby area in Bangalore. I like it !!,0

"The temple is nicely maintained with lots of parking places. Yes you have to go through a big queue but once you reach the main temple once will definitely like the place. The only thing is that while returning they make you pass through lots of shopping area and with the ladies with you, one ends up spending some amount there on shopping. The food etc available there is really good.",1
"Iskon Temple is fabulously maintained. Built in the 90's, it's pretty new as far as temples go. It gets full marks on cleanliness and the structure is quite imposing.
ISKON in general, with it's new-age take on Krishna has a fairly thought out commercial element to it too, with a cafeteria and shopping section. The food is great though!",1
"Love this place, worth visiting. I admire the support programs offered by the temple management to the under privileged children.
Visiting the temple and praying and meditating was a better experience when there wasnt much traffic around the locality.
I only wish the temple made sure the people who visit are quiet and respect the time and space of other devotees.
Temples are meant to be a non-chaotic peaceful place for an individual to find himself and God. Respecting their time and space is important.",1
Overall a good temple and quiet place to visit. Must visit at least once if going to nearby area in Bangalore. I like it !!,0
This place is very fresh and clean. The idols of Gods are beautiful and provide a very devotional experience. The evening Aarti is real attraction and i highly recommend it to even non-hindus as it provides a new kind of experience. Hindus would find this aarti very devotional as it is accompanied by music and dance. Plus there is a very cool vegetarian restaurant in the campus which provides an excellent buffet spread.,1
"I feel charged once i visit this holy temple.
Very powerful Lord Krishna temple,recommended for mind relaxation.",1
"Iskcon is an well maintained, clean temple which caters to varied type of people like adults, children, senior citizens and cultures. It has a good satvik restaurant Higher Taste which shows the culinary skills of making a variety of tasty foods whithout onion and garlic. The only issue is the access to Iskcon is crowed and during festivals, it is really difficult to get a parking space.",1
"Find tranquility in chaos. Living in Bangalore is equals living in a state of constant chaos. ISKCON is not just a place of worship, its a lifestyle. If you are looking for a place where you can find your sanctuary of spirituality along with a certain level of acceptance to a certain lifestyle, head here. u wont be disappointed.",1
It is a beautiful in Blore situated in the heart of the city with 1000of people visiting there will be nu\ice bajans in the evening the idols are great a must visit in Bangalore well maintained.,1
"A very peaceful & scenic place.
Good for a 2 hours visit, when not crowded.
It has a nice restaurant as well, which is totally vegetarian, with non onion-garlic preparations.
On specific days free prasad is served.
Maybe difficult for Sr. Citizens who may have to climb stairs to reach the main shrine.",1
Compared to other places in Bangalore its worth to spend our time in this temple....as mentioned in the title it is commercial one.,0
The view from this temple in and around the city in night time is wonderful experience. simply it is WOW experience.,1
"If you wish to spend time happily, visit ISKCON temple in the heart of the city. Temple is on the hillock and connected by bus and metro route. One can appreciate clean beautiful architecture and murmuring chanting of Hare Rama Hare Krishna. One should follow disciple (line) and have darshan and prasadam. You taste variety of foods ( all vegetarian dishes) and free prasadam. You can also take token for lunch and have full meals. Enjoy gift shop items, which are worth buying.",1
Its all about happiness. You can dance in joy all the way around. Nirtha Bhajan is the main attraction i personally like... Nothing much go ..enjoy,1

"You will like the temple for its grandeur, neatness and at the same time has the charm of the right hindu temple. You will also wonder why so many IITans, IIMs (Ex- now) are volunteers there. The temple needs little bit of climbing, as some people have pointed out, its not so friendly for differently able people/senior citizens.
Now as a temple, the place is a must visit, you will definitely be absorbed into the prayer rituals, bhajans, etc.,
You will also be able to get lot of literature on lord Krishna in particular and of course the Bhagawat Gita in almost all languages.
A must visit in Bangalore.",1
This is not a temple actually this would be called as shopping mall very very beautiful design of temple and while entering the Venkateshwara statue highlight of the temple,1
Good to visit with Family and in the evening time. Its a bit crowded so you reach the place by 5 P.M. to be able to get in easily.,1
"I have visited the IsKCON temple in seversl cities including Bangalore. However, our last experience was disappointing. We were not allowed to enter the temple as we were wearing sleeveless tops.. They offered to rent us a shawl for a price. But then, I was told my attire was not appropriate as my tights were above the ankle. That caught us off guard. I have never had this experience before.. As we wen
Re waiting to retrieve our shoes, we saw other womn in sleeveless (without shawls) coming out of the temple. When we confronte the staff, they dilly dallied and became rude..

Being an international traveller, I have no issues with respecting the local cultures, provided the same rules apply to all. we left ISKCON without visiting the temple.. Totally frustrated about the ad-hoc rules and the siper-aura of power and control exhited by the team at the security.. Hope they can be trained!!",1
"It is a temple built probably after 1990s... Nicely planned one. With small lawn and garden. Deity is Krsna. Radha Krishna & Gauranga-Nitai . You have temples of Narasimha & Balaji on way to Main temple.

You have ample parking space also very spacious shoes/chappal stand is there.
The philanthropic initiatives of the Temple, ""AKSHAYA PATHRA"" scheme through which the temple feeds poor children in 100s of schools in and around Bangalore.

You have a small museum also inside.
Temple is very organized and once you enter you will follow a queue for darshan of all deities and museum, then comes a stall where they sell souvenirs, photos etc,.

There is also 108 steps where you chant ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna..."" each step and enter the temple. But this is not compulsory.

DO NOT MISS THE VERY BIG PAINTINGS OF KRISHNA & HUGE CHANDELIERS ON THE ROOF OF MAIN DEITY HALL OF THE TEMPLE

Strangely you can find a prasadam stall where you find all sorts of eatables including bakery and other snacks..

For all devotees, the temple gives a cup of prasad (like pongal,curd rice etc).
For any one visiting Bangalore ISKCON is a must visit pilgirimage and good place.
Prefer evenings to fully enjoy the beauty.

It is well connected by Metro from Majestic (City Railway Station) and also plenty of city buses.",0

Temple is situated in a small hillock and the architecture is excellent. Well maintained and its a great place to visit by everyone and especially for Lord Krishna devotees.,1
Its great place to visit when you are in the city.Though little far from main city.Clean and very good peaceful environment.,1
Everyone in Bangalore should visit iskon temple at least once with family and friend. Well maintained also gives immense pleasure and peace of mind.,1

"1. Temple Approach: Good. No hassles.
2. Parking: good / adequate/ organised.

4. Lighting: excellent.
5. Housekeeping: excellent.
6. Ambience: excellent.
7. Administration: excellent.
8. Overall darshan / visit truly full-filling.",1
"It is a place full of mysticism place, much peace, and since the arrival you connect with the most basic things like feeling the contaco your feet with the ground, the atmosphere is full of peace and at the end there are places to buy souvenirs at affordable rates.",1
"I will not recommend this temple for foreigners,it's all for business,they forced me to buy a ticket 300 Rupees when you passed you will get 2 pieces of sweet and one book that I don't want them. my clothes were a long skirt and long blouse,and the lady wanted me to go and pay for their clothes again and you have to pay for keeping your shoes. I really disappointed.",1
"I like the temple but did not like the access to the temple. I was with senior citizens and there was no way they could reach to the main temple skipping stairs. For people who have difficulty walking or climbing stairs, visiting this place may not be a great idea. There aren't enough sign boards to indicate the ways and lot of times we felt lost. In terms of idol and temple it's indeed a nice one. Free Prasad is served on Sundays but for that also you have to take stairs and you will have to keep on asking directions.",1
"It's a grand temple as such, but you can find much more interesting ones in Bangalore. Also, it feels a bit odd that after visiting a place of worship you're taken into a large souvenir shop.",1
"The temple complex is very big with ample parking space. Very beautiful temple with lot of amenities. Indeed, one can experience the divine feel with the hymns and chants of Lord Krishna inside the temple. Many shopping stalls and bakery-snack outlets. The complex also houses yatri nivas and a pure sattvic vegetarian restaurant. Highly clean and a nice restaurant with good ambience, yummy food and good service.",0
"ISKCON is for the religious & devoted lot.
A Rich Temple in the form of material used to build the structure & lots of marble used.
Can pay a visit if you are the religious kind. ISKCON is based in many countries around the the world.
Gets very crowded at times & it would be good to choose a convenient time to visit.",1
"The ISKCON temple is located near the city centre with close proximity to the famous Orion mall. Even though it's on a hill, no trek can be carried out as such as it has been barricaded and roads have been paved to accommodate the rush of devotees. This temple is dedicated to lord Krishna and the crowd during the birthday of the lord, i.e., janmasthmi is crazy. I have never been into the temple so I have no idea of what's its inside.",1
"Amazing Place, Neat and Clean, Very Spiritual, Well Maintained Temple and the place really mesmerizes you, want to visit again and again",0
"It's nice place, temple is very well and cleanly maintained.

Must visit place in Bangalore

Entry fee
No parking fee",1
Temple is one of the best place I never seen in my life ............located at north banglore best place I used to visit,1
"ISCON Bangalore is located on the top of a small hill. It has good connectivity via road and metro. You don't have to worry about your footwear, they have a dedicated and safe place with the token system. You need to climb few stairs and enter via 108 stones on the ground while chanting Hare Krishna mantra. Temple is very huge and pretty, you can sit inside and do Dhyan and feel the beauty of Krishna. Down the temple they have shops where you can buy various spiritual stuff and also the food items. Overall it is an excellent experience. A must visit place for all.",0
Well maintained place but after darshan you feel like you have entered into some kind of bakery or shop.,1
It's ok place to visit . Don't pay any ticket for special ticket. It's not worth it. Line moves fast . Go there early . Wear appropriate dress for the temple . Long pants and shirts .,1
"It is next to World Trade Center building, beautiful place. You can sit for hours & chant krishna & can meditate . YOu can reach by metro connectivity too .",1
This temple was one of the highlights of our trip. We chanted the 108 steps and saw a play outside afterwards. Highly recommended.,1
This is located in North Bangalore and next to World Trade center and Mariott Hotel . You can access this by Metro route.,1
A must place to visit in Bangalore. Temple is built for Lord Krishna. All the time we spend in the temple we find the inner peace and so pleasant. The ISKCON tradition and customs are very different and difficult to fellow.,1
"Very Serene, amidst the crowd. Wonderful prasadams and lot of snack options for food. Wonderfully cooked veg delicacies. Soul soothing music. A must visit in Bnglore.",1
"A good place to visit.
You can sit inside the temple and u will feel comforting 4 sure. Good place.
A well organised system for shoes..can visit anytime...",1
"It a fantastic architecture and a place of worship for peace lovers, the temple has main of shri krishna, Narashimar and Balaji",1
"We often visit this temple and get inspired by the Deeparathi during evening everyday.
This temple is located near metro station and can be easily reached from bus station. This place is covered by Daily tourist attractions. You can see this by buying KSTDC ticket for Bengaluru sight seeing also.
This place is abled friendly and can be visited by one and all.
The temple runs two canteens which cater to devotees requirements. Purely vegetarian.
One among ten top places to visit in Bengaluru.",1
Lord Krishna is the God here and very peace full place with lot scope for mediation architecture is very good,1
"ISKCON is a fantastic abode on top of the hill on west of chord road, near Rajajinagar, Bangalore. It's a nice place to remove the baggage of nonsense we carry in our head. Sing and dance in the glory of the tune of Hare Krishna and unwind, refresh and regrow the spirituality in yourself. Be there early morning and late evening for the Mahamangalarthi. There are discourses on Srimad Bhagvad Gita, especially on weekends. There is an AV presentation on the greatness and Leelas (pranks) of the beautiful Sri Krishna. If you have a team of people, or corporate team who are looking for refreshing your understanding of our beloved sacred book, The One and Only Bhagvad Gita, then just contact their office. The evening lighting, waterflow, evening prasaad, are all greart feature of this wonderful place. There are upadevathas of Shri Venkateshawara and Shri Nrasimha at different levels of the hill. and the",1
"Visited this temple multiple times, itis very good Krishna temple and all the other smaller temples are also very good. The temple is big enogugh and does not fell crowded.

The negatives is too much commercialization on the way out, too many shops and that beats the temple feel",1
For the first time goer it looks like a awesome place ...the crowd is more and everywhere and each place is commercialized ...from shoe stand to restaurant..the central dome was awesome and mesmerizing ...the krishna and balaram idols are very attractive..everywhere shops are available throughout the exit path and allure to purchase some items in the name sake of lord krishna..you get the bagadgita in all languages...the only free item at the end is hot kitchidi...they serve u only one cup ..after losing your energy..you feel like having one...they does not serve you more than one..in other iskon temples around the world they provide you the decent lunch..here is not the case.,0
"Old temple set in a metro city. Well laid out, parking available, great prasad and gift shop. Inside the temple is well maintained.",1
"I read that I should have a couple of hours, but during a Saturday afternoon, did not find the temple to be busy at all, was therefore able to use the extra hour saved by visiting the Orion mall nearby.",1
"ISKON bengaluru, is a beautiful temple located on a small hill. The view from temple is beautiful and the inside is amazing. Nothing much to write about a temple. A definitely go place.",0
"If you visit one place in Bangalore this has to be your choice. The cultural experience is unlike any other. If you only went for the food you will be more than satisfied. Also, best prices on local souvenirs you will find!",1
"We were western visitors and were charged a higher entry fee - something not uncommon in India and honestly, we respect that we have the means to pay a little more. It was worth it! The higher fee also afforded us an escort by one of their volunteers and the ability to take photos. Please do visit and use the opportuntiy to reflect and pray.",1
The architecture of the temple is really impressive. The place is well organised but most often found to be crowded. But worth the visit. They have strict security checks and no photography allowed inside. Stores and food items are also available.,1
"Very beautiful temple, worth a visit. Its very clean and maintained nicely. Though gets crowded during evenings.

The quality of food available there is not that great. Isckon Mumbai is way better for food options.",1
"Good temple to visit . Very near to Yeswantpur railway station. Easily accelerated from majestic.
Temple well constructed and maintained . Krishna is main god. Lots of social activities carried ISKCON organisation . You can visit their kitchen Akshaya pathra which helps in feeding many poor .

Do visit when you visit Bangalore.",1
"The center of the temple is beautiful but there is a 20 minute process (assuming no line) for you to get in, between the multiple turnstiles, shoe drop, bag drop, etc. It felt a bit like going to an amusement park.",0
Excellent place to visit . This is my 5th ISKON temple visit. This is absolutely great place. Fabulous place.,1
It is best place to keep you in full mediating stage and feel the presence of Krishna bhagwan and his life and also to attract with such a wonderful artistic.,1
Very calm & peaceful place right in middle of the busy bebgaluru city. Must visit while you are in Bangalore,0
"Great place to visit in Bangalore, Temple located in hill (small hill), temple architecture is really superb. Evening is the best time to visit the temple. Lord Krishna attracts you. Here before you entering to Lord Krishna you visit Lord ""BALAJI"", ""NARASIMHA"". But only thing is the food rates are very costly like hotels apart from that superb place.",1
"Honestly, I have never been able to relate myself to the ISKCON ideologies. Traditional places of worship attract me more. Nevertheless, I am rating it high for the way its run and has been maintained..do not miss the Prasad",1
"Beautiful temple to visit and its worth seen place, beauty of the temple attract lots of people here, I visited this place on Janamastmi on august and got impress with its notified infrastructure, arrangement done by authority, feeling great inner peace and satisfaction. jai Shree Krishna.",1
"its worth going to this temple,i went around 4pm and it was so crowded,peoplecome here to worship,its beautiful",1
"This place is more like a mini shopping mall rather than a temple. You simply cannot get a spiritual feel inside ISKCON that you would get inside other temples.

It has been built beautifully with all the granite and marble and yes it does have a beautiful architecture. But after visiting the deity, when you come down you can literally see a restaurant/bakery inside. Following that you have stalls that sell you different items. I think this is exploitation of faith and this definitely is not indicative of the sanctity of a temple.

Simply put, Its more a man-made hybrid of a temple and mall where people would be going more in curiosity to see what all the noise is about rather than to actually pray.

Its definitely worth a one-time visit but this is simply not the place for spirituality or to find your calling.",1
Temple is quite big ...the main hall is really big and beautiful. Can see people dancing and singing bhajan in centre of the hall... The darsan of all the god in temple good .... Darsan in such an environment make us feel happy about the visit.... After darsan we have option of buying lot many religious stuff including prasad and food items made as per the temple custom..... Pricing is not too high.... At the end before exit temple provide prasad to all the visitors.... camera are not allowed inside the temple all footwear had to be deposited at the entrance.....also if hold membership card then get special entry in the temple....,1
"Beautiful place, very nice to see the rituals. Really a pleasure to visit when you are in Bangalore. Best temple I visited so far",1
"By stepping in the foothills of ISKCON, you are in the abode of the Divine. Lord Venkateshwara & Krishna bestows the blessings to each one of the devotee visiting the Temple.",1
"They have done a great job maintaining this place right in the heart of city. Be prepared to walk and climb as this is built on a hill. The temple sanctum is very serene and well maintained. Great place to pray. At the end of darshan you get prasad to eat. They have a book store, which is very good. They make sure you cannot exit till you walk through a quarter mile of hawkers selling every conceivable thing you can imagine and food. Be patient, this is all part of getting you to heaven smiling all the way. No photography allowed.",1
"This beautiful building is dedicated to Hare Krishna. As with the other temples, shoes are taken off and left at a shoe stand for 2 rupees (or in your bag). After going through security (photos not allowed inside), you are guided through the temple by following the posted signs.

The staff are very helpful and will talk with you about Hare Krishna and suggest books based on your curiosities or questions. The staff also serve a simple free lunch for visitors in the late morning.

It's worth a visit if you're interested in learning about Hare Krishna and seeing this impressive structure.",1
"The temple inside is interesting but to get out is a maze of shops and all of them carry the same items. By the 5 or 6th time you've seen something, you're likely to give in.",1
"Very well maintained overall

You will get peace of mind if you spend about half an hour there.

Location wise also very good( very near to Orion mall,yeshwanthpur)

A bit too much of religious shopping points though",1
Recently visited ISKCON temple in Bangalore on Balram Jayanti and it was so beautiful to see the decorations. Musicians were present and a huge amount of crowd had turned up for the event. Extremely amazing scenes.,1
"One of the biggest and good temple in the city. Most visiting temple for learning and for peace of mind. My request. Please visit the temple and seek blessings of lord krishna.
Hare rama hare krishna",1
"For only about $6, the paid entry whizzes you through to the key parts of the temple, and includes free gifts. It's a really interesting building, stacked in stages, leading up to a main temple buzzing with chants, noise and colour.

Leave your big cameras at home as they are not allowed in - it will be taken off you at the gate (although the facilities to leave items seems a bit ropey, I received mine back with no issues)",0
I got a bunch of blessings here and liked the food but there's something odd about the laddu. Very beautiful modern temple!,1
Its more of a tourist attraction than a temple. Priests will ask you money for almost everything. Food is good since they have something restaurant kind of there .,1
"Attended evening aarti (7:00 PM) at ISKCON temple Bangalore, I think it is the best time to visit temple, it is a very beautiful temple, great piece of architecture, motivational. There is one canteen in the campus which servers delicious dishes.",1
"Good place to visit temple in Bangalore.
Take note of timings while visiting the temple.

The ISKON temple at Bengaluru is located in large spacious grounds . The entire temple complex is maintained very well. We had been in the evening and hence were able to participate in the evening Aarti. Overall a nice and peaceful place of worship to visit in Bengaluru.,0
As it's little far from my home took almost 2hours to reach there. Place is well organised and you want see long queues and stamped. Just little rush when you enter into the main temple Dom. But would be great If you visit in non festival time. You will enjoy more. No need of paying for VIP darshan. If you want you can make it in one hour . don't stop for buying from stalls unless you wanna buy something.,1
The temple is really beautiful and we have been there during the evening time along with family had a great time being there.,0
"Other than Religious point of you , the temple can be visited to admire the architecture.
Just go there and let yourself float in the waves of devotion.

Hare raam hare raam, raam raam hare hare
Hare krishna hare krishna , krishna krishna hare hare.

I felt very nice visiting the temple. The interiors are very beautiful and the overall feeling is very pristine,1
"Iskcon Temple, Bangalore is spread across 7 acres of land and it is the one of largest Iskcon temples in the world. It The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is a devotional tradition based on the teachings of Bhagavadgita and the Bhagavat Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam).

Free tasty prasada is offered from morning till evening in the temple premises.",1
"There are many different shrines inside and it is well organized and you are automatically guided through. The key is that you can also enter without buying a ticket for 1000 Rupies. Be aware that you need long shorts and women cover their shoulders. Everything is bare foot.
Towards the end there are many options to donate and buy stuff, however, people are friendly even if you decline.
I liked to observe the worshippers and how they celebrated in the temple. It was worth the visit.",1
"The temple is bigger than Mumbai Iskcon and thankfully has plenty of paid parking space available. Temple is very clean and the evening Aarti would be a great treat for all Krishna followers. Plenty of eating options available to choose from. All in all, a nice place to visit with family",1
"Iskcon temple is a huge the,male complex in west off chord road. It not only has a temple but also a huge shopping centre as well. Very clean and well maintained.",1
"Beautiful temple to visit. The place is quiet and clean.

Beware of cheap quality products sold in the temple.",1
"ISKON is always very peaceful to visit. Goo time is to vista's around noon as the at 12.30pm you get to see the aarti also. The crowd is very well managed by volunteers wich makes the visit tension free. Elderly can go up in wheelchair using a lift.
Inside the mandir you get laddos as snacks like samosa, kachoree, gila jamun, bhajee etc followed by piping hot prasad at the exit.
Outside you have a cafe and find dining- Higher Taste. Food at both the place is good.
On the whole a great experience.",1

Very big temple. With lots of lights and one would go amazed to see that colorful monuments. Very near to metro as well.,1
"A very serene, peaceful & spiritual place. The moment u enter the temple's complex, there's a security check, no photography is allowed inside the temple. U will start chanting the Hare Krishna mantra before entering the main sanctum to pay respects to the beautiful Krishna, chanting is not compulsary however but u observe total silence and unconsciously u wld have chanted the mantra 108 times!
Free prasad is given towards the end of your visit before you exit the temple. Lots of savoury and sweet snacks on sale too. Lots of souvenirs are also on sale. A beautiful temple to visit.",1
Came in here unintentionally and was pleasantly surprised. The complex is quite huge and very clean and well maintained. It is free to enter and walk around. A popular temple and site of devotion it was stunning and nice to visit especially since it is right in the middle of the bustling city. Overall i really enjoyed the visit and even got into a little discussion with the priest who was trying quite desperately to convince us to buy a book on Krishna but don't let it put you off. At the end of the visit you can indulge in some of the local delicacies.,1
"A great experience visiting this temple. A Rs 300 ticket per family enables you a great darshan, aarti and a few quiet moments in the sanctum. Certainly worth a visit",1
"A nice and peaceful place in Bangalore. Awesome architecture. Came here with family and we felt good.

One suggestion: don't miss this place if you visit Bangalore.",1
"Imaging temple with statues of Lord Krishna and other gods.Remains crowdy on Sundays. Avoid to visit on Sunday.
Nice spiritual place.",1
"Just like all the ISKCON temples, this one is also a classic structure,
well built
well laid out
Quite spaceous
the pooja/aarti is a must go. try the evening one.
if you are if you lucky enough, you can get a chance to join along with the temple clan singing the bhajans/praises of lord krishna.

Overall its a good experience for exploring the cultural side of the city.
Try the food here, its different than usual but feels organic.",1

We visited ISCON temple in eve of 20th Sept 2016. The temple has ample parking space and is on a small hill and hence might require climbing if not in a car. Parking ticket is Rs 30. The temple is well maintained and quiet. Please bear in mind that sleeveless tops and shorts or 3/4ths are not allowed for both men and women. But if you happen to be in wrong attire they would provide dhoti to wrap around for Rs 20 which is non refundable and a refundable deposit of Rs 500 per piece. After the Darshan the exit takes you through the shop and canteen where you can buy food items prepared in the temple. The food is very good especially Mallpoa and should be tried.,1
"its a very big temple and devotional too, very peaceful , u can go along with family and have fun must visit temple in banglore",1
The best thing in this temple is the Prasadam and the last Aarti of the day. The view from the terrace before the Main temple Stairs is awesome,1
The temple is a neat and clean place with plenty of place around where you need to walk uphill and on return walk through various displays of temple merchandises and soveniors. visit to the Isckon managed temple is definitely a pleasant experiance,1
"Bengaluru can boast of many temples, churches and mosques which are quite popular. None can match the beauty and ambiance of the ISKON temple.",1
"While reaching the main gate of temple in rajajinagar our driver guided to hurry up, We rushed into the main gate because temple will be closing around 1 Pm, security people allowed us inside
it was very nice and peaceful environment, while visiting the temple main hall, bhajans and chanting hare Krishna hare rama will make you a peaceful mind. temple closed around 1 Pm While coming back had seen people are selling photos and small idols of Lord Krishna with other books and toys had also scene fresh sweets and snacks selling in very hygienic environment we had launch as prasadam sponsored by a well wisher of krishna devotees, it was nice relaxed refreshing mind while stepping down from the temple",1
"The place is well maintained, managed and you have have ample souvenirs to pick on the way out.
Only if the crowd will have more etiquette on behaving and going around in public place the trip could have been great.",1
"Very peaceful, very connecting to Krishna. I simple love this temple. I generally go here and spend good time. It also has some very good eateries as you come out and afterall it is the Krishna Connect",1
"A great spiritual experience is assured by visiting ISKON temple at Bangalore. Neatly maintained. Chanting of Hare Rama Hare Krishna 108 times on the queue is unique. The deities of Radha , Krishna , Balarama are so beautiful that one can keep watching them. Besides these there is also Narsimha and Venkateshwara shrines. They distribute free prasadam (Pongal etc) while coming out. There are good number of counters for buying sovereigns, food items (wide varieties). They have a free Chappal stand.Temple closed between 1 to 4 PM. Temple can be easily accessed by bus, auto.",0
Very well developed temple with so many activities and they make sure u don't miss anything u r journey is well guide by management u start with bhagvan Puja and end with pet Puja that means food u r stomach feed,0
"It is really very nice visit. very peaceful & very clean. Gold plated kalash shikara & flag post. There is free distribution of Sri Krishna prasadam to all visitors during the darshana hours.
The temple is open from 4:15 am to 5:00 am",1
"Have been to the place twice. And loved it. Calm, knowledgeable and Spiritual centeric. The biggest iskon in the world.",1
"Very well managed, right from shoe/chappal deposit/collection to queue system for the darshan. Although parking is available, but i would advice to take a cab to this place. Not a good idea to take kids on certain occasions like Krishna Janmastami, temple gets over crowded.",1
"The temple and the surrounding areas has been maintained with a very good ambience, inspite of the high crowd there. Good place to spend an evening",1
Its a Wonderful Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Bangalore It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world . i went with my family members. very peaceful place and i really felt the same.The inside of the temple is mesmerizing.Foreigners also allowed.Strict security and dress code maintained.i really enjoyed a LOT!!!,1
"It's a huge beautifully constructed temple , good scenic view as u go on...calm n peaceful atmosphere . Shopping lovers can enjoy the colourful sculpture and and cute Lord Krishna's gift items n and foodies can try different kids of fried items n egg less pastries ... They also play a 20 min animated movie so u can sit bak and enjoy with you kids n have a good day all along",1
"One of best maintained iSKCON temples in india. Highly spiritual. The ambiance and atmosphere is so good, you go into a different world altogether. Extremely well organised even there is a huge crowd. Free and whole sum food given to all pilgrims.
One can indulge in shopping and eating as you exit after the darshan. Good books and other artifacts are available for sale.
One of other good feature is the restaurant "" Higher Taste"", good tasty satvik food and host of items to choose from, but no onions and garlic.
Even the rooms are very good and it is centrally located even for business people.",1
After the whole days sightseeing...the best place to spend your evening in such a divine place. very beautiful view at night and the feel of the surroundings is mesmerizing. would love to visit here again.,1
"This place is peaceful n neat always, lord Krishna idol n the other sculptures at this place are very beautiful.",1
"We Indians are used to seeing dozens of temples in very city, but only a few are well designed, efficiently administered and expansive. Almost like a private commercial enterprise, the ISKCON temple in Bangalore can change your perspective of what a modern Indian temple can be. I have visited ISKCONs in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Boston... This one has to be a mile above and beyond any of them. It also houses the world famous Akshaya Patra free meal kitchen which has been featured in National Geographic's TV series.",0
"Good and Peaceful place to visit at any point of time all around 365 days.
You can go with family, friends and Solo too.....in one hour you can finish the visit but I don't think if anyone will go there and come back in one hour. You will feel like be there itself...",1
"ISKCON temple takes you to a spiritual realm that you can feel nowhere else. There are temples & then there is ISKCON. If you visit Bangalore, make it a point to visit the ISKCON.",1
A small hill lock which was abondoned due to rocks earlier was converted to temple with modern architecture. Once you enter at different levels you find small temples and finally the place of Krishna idol. Overall the inner feeling of visiting temple is missing and feels artificial.,1
"The place is majestic and nice place for evening outing. The inside of the temple is mesmerizing, and the facilities are also commendable.",1
"Very clean (which is very rare to find in India) hindu temple. Run like a corporate office. Offers good views. Very organised and one can easily find parking too even though this place is often very crowded.

They maintain a strict code of silence in sanctum sanctorum. They have a funny prasadams (holy food offered to God which is subsequently sold to devotees) which are modern sweets and namkheen.

Good place to visit when in Bangalore for holiday and sight seeing.",1
"It is to be seen to be believed the way Gokulashtami also called Sri Krishna Janmashtami is celebrated in ISKCON specially Bengaluru and in Salem as well.

Very grand very religious is all that I can tell.",1
"This is a beautiful, tranquil place of worship atop a small hillock. It is a huge complex with the main Krishna temple on top of the hill. Arati times are especially wonderful in the mornings when there is chanting of bhajans, all devotees are handed text of the bhajans so everybody joins in the singing creating a surreal atmosphere. If you're a member, you get special privelege of being in the first line for darshan. It is a nice place to visit with family.",1
"A beautiful,serene temple of Lord Krishna. Has a lovely calm and peaceful ambience and also can be visited as a tourist spot by tourists of any caste.Foreigners also allowed.Strict security and dress code maintained.It is in Rajajinagar, Bangalore,India.Can be reached by taxi or metro.The closest metro station is Yeshwantpur.",1
You feel the world of peace. Rejuvenate with energy all time on your every visit. This place you can't miss at any cost. Amazing aesthetics and environment. Class of its management . You will wonder to watch the classy result of blend of mythology and professionalism,1
Very Clean place for worship. Food in Higher Taste- Vegetarian food- excellent. Lot of choice. Moderate charges for the spread.,1
"Good .
Very Happy to view and visit this Temple.
Worth going here
.
Ashtami celebration are awesome.",1
Don't miss this place if you are planning sightseeing in Bangalore. Very calm place especially inside the main temple. Weekends bit crowded and you may need to wait 30 mins to 1hr to get the darshan,1
"The road leading to the place is always dense with traffic. However once you enter the premises, it is fine. Parking space is available. There is a high class restaurant too. The problem is for all those who find it difficult to walk due to old age or obesity or such other reasons since the the whole area including the temple building itself are not in a plain plane and one has to walk up and down the roads or stairs. Even the temple is built at various levels. In some portions, lifts are there ur it would be impossible to avoid altogether climbing up & down.",1
"Last time when I visited Bangalore decades ago, ISKCON temple was not there. This time when I visit Bengaluru, Bengaluru has several gems in its crown and ISKCON temple indeed deserves a central attention place.

It's an admirably treat for eyes for devotees and tourists alike. Beautifully crafted architecture and design, craftsmanship, Grand Idols of RadhaKrishna & ors. Maybe you have seen lots of other ISKCON temples in other parts of India and probably all appear same. Even then if you are in Bengaluru, don't miss ISKCON. Give it one hour minimum, if you can. Krishna is going to be a nice experience and feel. Please Don't opt for special Darshanam. Move as a common simple man and enjoy Krishna's Consciousness in everyone you see, then, may be for a split second, you may feel it is Krishna Consciousness in you too. In case you want to offer any puja etc then you may buy the same at prescribed counter by tendering prescribed amount and obtain a receipt.

Besides devotional feature, equal emphasis is on Marketing feature. You can Sell God in India. Incredible India it is. May be our great seers like Swami Prabhupad or Acharya Rajneesh never even wildly imagined in their life times that they themselves are Saint Peter of Today's Vatican. But one thing whatsoever they sell, let it be books, audio, idols, souvenirs, every piece is beautifully crafted and produced. You will not regret for quality of products.

There is a free kitchen besides other selling points for a variety of delicacies of India. The kitchen provides free food to whosoever comes to eat and trust me the food is simply delicious.

Here in this complex, I fear one of the big shortcoming is parking. Lots and lots of tourists visit and parking space for vehicles is going to be a big issue, if not attended in time.

Worth a Chant "" krsna krsna hare hare "".",1
"ISKCON Temple: It is one of the most popular temples, particularly of the recent past. It has a top quality management, which manages the temple on professional lines.
On normal days you will find crowds entering through the main gates will be able to drive through almost till the main entrance to the temple.
The temple is located over a hilly-land area of aprox 7-8 Acres, this was just another hill which was transformed into this amazing temple by the efforts of the temple committee. It incorporates a wonderful synthesis and fusion of traditional temple architecture with modern principles of construction and civil engineering.
When you access the temple premises by foot, you will initially reach a footwear leaving place where you can deposit your footwear and walk further up to the actual temple environs. You will notice that most of the pathway is protected against rain and hot sun for those special days.
You will soon be at the very entrance to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple where you will be faced with two options of going through the 108 rounded steps wherein you can enjoy the charm of reciting the Hare Krishna mahamantra on each step while waiting for the Queue to move forward, and this will be an enjoyable experience which is relished by many. Alternately, you can also by-pass this and use the other direct route, if you are short of time, wherein you can go to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple by the side route.
When you enter the Sh. Laxmi Narasimha Swamy temple you will be struck by the awesome beauty and the amazing sculpture work of the main deity over here, you will want to stare at it to eternity and will be lost in spiritual ecstasy, however, life must move on and the crowds behind you would also want to have a glimpse of the Lord, and so they will usher you to the next temple. Do remember to pay your obeisance/worship to the Deities of Garudadeva and Shri. Hanuman on either side at the entrance of the Narasimha shrine.
You will now be at the entrance of the Shri Srinivasa Govinda Temple where you will once again be mesmerized by the outstanding fineness and excellence of the sculpture work and you will feel as if you have been magically and suddenly tranlocated to Tirupati. After you enjoy the reverberations of Govinda, Govinda, you will now head to the main temple.
The vast main hall on level 3 is accessed by wide steps with banisters and has a beautiful gold plated altar, with attractive interior designs and a ceiling with huge paintings, which are held together from the roof down, depicting the pastimes of Lord Krishna with His devotees.
There is an all round internal balcony which gives a view of the temple sanctum sanctorum and this adds to the glamour and beauty of this place and also gives a birds eye view for the people during festivities when the crowds are spilling into the streets a kilometer or two long on occassions like Janmashtami etc.
Everyday thousands of devotees from various parts of India and other countries visit the temple to seek the blessings of Their Lordships.
At the main temple you will be bewitched by extraordinary beauty of The Presiding Deities in the temple Sri Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Krishna Balarama and Sri Nitai Gauranga (Sri Nityananda Prabhu and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu). After having prayed to their lordships to your hearts content, remember to offer your respects to the most beautiful bronze sculpture of Srila Prabhupada who is peacefully witness to all the goings on in the temple and who guides the same by his divine presence.
You will also see the endless rows of books by Srila and other devotees which are available for sale. If possible one should take this opportunity to contribute towards a life membership of ISKCON which will also feed millions of children in schools through the Akshaya Patre (endless supply of food, originally given by Lord Surya the Sun God to Yudhishtira, the Pandava King) program.
While you allow all these things to soak into your mind and body, get back to Planet Earth and head towards the exit you will find lots of shops and sales points where every type of devotional stuff and vegetable eatery is available to satiate your taste buds, do check them out if you are in a hurry to move to the next location on your itinerary, otherwise head straight to the Higher Taste Restaurant in the same premises to eat like the Kings & his courtiers, see review separately for The Higher Taste Restaurant.",1
A place to visit again and again.. Such a decent place.. What a nice feeling to be at the temple.. And the food served is just amazing.. Not sure what is the right time to visit to avoid the crowd.,0
"So finally one more iskon temple I visited after Delhi , Mumbai and mathura vrindaban. Peaceful and soothing environment in temple shrine.",1
"Beautifully made. you will feel peaceful there. Good place for religious or non religious people. Free prasad available. Be aware of buying anything there, as too costly.",1
"Built on top of Hare Krishna Hill, this is one of the most beautiful ISKCON temples I've visited. The ambience and view of the city is breathtaking. Best to avoid popular festival days if you want to enjoy this place at your own pace.",1
Early morning visiting ISKON temple made our day so spiritual. Nice and well organized temple.have divine shopping facilities too.,1
Avoid visiting the place on weekends. It is a little climb but the view from the top is beautiful. The architecture of the temple is amazing . While leaving they do offer you a plate of prasad.,1
"You can achieve spiritual peace and inner peace here, of course, with your own efforts. Better place to spend alone, sitting by the top of the temple place. Hot Kichidi is served as prasad, and it tastes like heaven.",1
Well organized and peaceful temple with good food.Higher taste restaurant is my all time favorite.Ample parking.,0
This Iskcon is as nice as any other Iskcon I have seen in the world. It has a restaurant with amazing indian food.,1
I must say that many of the modern day devotional institution that exist today are just meant to attract people's attention and forget to bring divinity. ISKON is one among them. There are too many shops inside and hence I have to say this.,1
"Clean, organised and beautiful are the words which describe this better. Its a vast temple on a hill with beautiful views inside and outside. Its beauty cannot be explained and has to be seen. Overall worth the time spent there.",1
This is the only temple of ISCON which is Blue in exterior in line to the color of Lord Krishna. This temple is modern type architecture and is situated on main road and very near to the road connecting city with the outer roads towards yashwantpur. There is good and clean facility of vegetarian eateries and parking facility within temple premises. Neat and clean temple stand out glowing in blur hue during night and is one of the most visited landmark in Bengaluru,1
"I visited isckon temple when I went to Bangalore last visit during march.It is a very beautiful temple of Lord Krishna.
very good decorations inside the temple and also very good shops and eating outlets in the temple.",1
"Much like most other ISCKON temples, the grandeur of the temple is nothing short of mesmerizing. One can sit and keep adoring the beauty all day. Te inside of the main temple is breath-taking and stunning. There is however something that I don't like about it is the way it is deliberately given an angle of a shopping center with limitless merchandises that one can buy. It is really commercialized, if you will! Other than which, there is really no ticket to visit the temple. It is located right by the Orion mall so while you are there, it is certainly worth your time unless you are an atheist. There is also a nice restaurant right behind the temple - Higher Taste - that one must try out for a finger licking dining experience!",1
Not a nice place to visit. You will be insisted on to buy a special pass that none of the locals will buy. Then it is a one way maze of processions around various parts of the temple. With lots of opportunities to spend money on goods and knick knacks. Avoid if you're not in the mood for chaos and pushy people.,0
"I am not very religious in the sense that I am not one to worship too many idols and believe in rituals. I went to this temple purely as a tourist. I did not expect the visit to be so time-consuming; I mean, after all it is just a temple and if you do not sit down to pray and all, how long should it take. But I was wrong. They move inside the temple one step at a time on each ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" chant. This means that you take at least 20-25 minutes just to enter the temple. The temple is very beautiful and grand. The chants and music are very soothing and calms you down. The whole atmosphere is very enigmatic if you ignore the very in-your-face commercial aspect of the temple. (They are selling books and hoardes of other stuff - even the prasadam - at every corner). Overall a good experience but nothing worth remembering for very long.",1
"Cannot take photos inside, but it was definitely an experience to remember. There were too many people lined up, and you had to do the normal taking off of shoes, washing of feet. It's a long walk up the temple, but you get a good idea of how people worship and serve. When you get out after paying respect, there is so much food available- for purchase, and for free. Make sure to come here with clothes that are not too revealing because they will try and cover you at the entrance.",1
Devotional place to spend some time in Bangalore. Went there on a weekend and it was really crowded but its worth the wait and the queue. A must visit if you are in Bangalore.,1
"The ISKCON temple is an iconic landmark in Bangalore, with an excellent temple, providing great food facilities and also supporting a lot of charity work.",1
"First of all i'm not an atheist.By the experience gained by me after visiting this place i'm reviewing this.Coming to the main part the temple is simply amazing by it's architecture and cleanliness.Best place to visit with family on a weekend.Once the darshan is done,you will enter into the shopping mall.There is no way to skip this part.One more thing is don't miss the free prasadam which is finger licking good :)",1
"Our taxi driver recomended this mandir as a tourist attraction. We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness, organization and quiet. The idols were very well cared for and beautifully adorned. There was a wide variety of food options at the food court. Keep it up!",1
There is nothing to say about this temple... anywhere you visit you will feel peace of mind and the same I felt visiting here. It is situated near to Mahalaxmi Metro Station.,1
The peace I felt there. I can't express in words overall must visit place.The prashada nd every experience was just awesome,1
Great spiritual atmosphere and excellent prasadam/food to complement. A bit far from center of city though.,1
The place is very organised and maintained exceptionally well. Please note that photography is not allowed inside the temple.,1
"When on a Saturday to have darshan of god..its a pure divine place..the articles we get it here are too good & the food available is very tasting ..Dhokla ,jalebi,bhajji n so much",1
"Best krishna temple in Bangalore and first Iskcon temple in bengaluru. The temple has a huge complex n usually gets crowded on weekends. Their style of aarti is unique , they sell various products and offer various food items to buy.",1
The main temple is impressive with all golden details but there is too many visitors at ones and the visit feels a bit stressed and you are not allowed to take pictures inside,1
"Nice place to visit, good maintenance and organized darshan. It would have been better if no commercial complex after the darshan.",1
"Connected by Metro, Bus, Train this is the best Iskcon Temple I have visited.. Temple is beautiful, situated on a hill and there is a sense of positivity inside it.. Must visit when in Bangalore",1
"Bangalore ISKCON temple is a must visit temple in the city. The interior and exterior of the temple is simply superb. U will love to hear the sound of ""HARE RAMA HARE RAMA, RAMA RAMA HARE HARE, HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA, KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE"". Prasadam is too tasty ‚ò∫Ô∏è. We can BHAGAVADGEETHA books in all the languages at good price.",0
"First of all, photography (whether you use a camera or phone) is not allowed inside. Backpacks or big bags are also not allowed. Footwear is not allowed. Sleeveless tops are not allowed. So at the entrance, you'll have to deposit everything not allowed and they will give you claim stubs for them. Entrance to the temple is free but they also have a ""special entry pass"" for 300INR. Not sure if that was only because it was Independence Day (August 15) or if they always have that. Anyway, what's good about the pass, especially if you're a tourist in a hurry, is you get to bypass the queue of devotees. When we were there, it was full house so the special entry pass gave us our space and we got to walk according to our pace. I hope that made sense. Anyway, since it was a real temple of worship we participated in the ritual with much respect. It was a unique and wonderful experience for us. If you're a bit of a clean freak like me, don't forget to bring wet wipes for your feet afterwards.",1
Uf you want to spend some quality time with peace of mind go to Iskon temple. Mental peace also comes with spiritual atmosphere.,1
Visit early morning for aarti before the gates are opened infront of the idols. It feels like heaven,1
Best place to visit. Just few meters distance from metro station. Near Orion mall. One must visit while in Bangalore.,1
"Very Nice Religious place

There are many tourist and religious places in and around Bangalore. It is one of tourist attractions places of Bangalore. Me and my family are visited this place. very Beautiful Temple and Nice Place, very clean and well maintained. must visit this temple. Memorable Experience. Awesome....",0
"I am very happy to visit the Temple, very calm, I forgot all my problems, you can see all religion people come here",1

It's really a attractive temple situated near Yesvantpur well known for Radha-Krishna temple. You find an inner peace after visiting there.,1
"very beautifull and very peacefull place in bangalore, i am very beloved one, i am full happy to see this place",1
There I didn't even find any peace... It's more about commercial.... You know isckon places first in India's richest earnings.... This isckon belongs to some foreigner.... Not even Indian... If you wanna see some place then visit this place... But don't come here for peace and godliness...,1
"I had been at ISKCON temple many times, and i always i like place and feel time well spent . This time I went with few senior citizens in family and opted to take lift service as it wa slate evening on Tuesday, and delighted to see it directly took us in the main temple at top where final Aaarti and Palki yata was about to start, being a weekday not many people were there like weekend , so got enough time and close view of all proceeding, After pooja , we came down by lift , but they have introduced another exit for regular visitors, which does not take through all counters for articles there. we harldy spent any time more than what we spent in temple, it was the time well spend with maximum happiness and satisfcation.",1
"If you are a 1st timer in Bangalore and wondering what Bangalore can offer other than pubs and eateries, you wouldn't regret your visit to ISKON. This place not just about deities placed in a sanctum. It's quiet a big area to walk around, sit at leisure by the fountain, buy books, shop tiny give-away and not to miss lovely veg food at ''The Higher Taste''.",1
dear all my friends very good place in Bangalore tank you to hotelier and car driver we are relay happy for trip,1
one of the best place to visit along with the family really peaceful and devotional cell phones are not allowed inside you can have a nice time and there are some snack items available inside the temple it will be really wonderful during the night times,1

"famous temple for the lord shri krishna. beautiful place with peace, devotion and prayers. the carvings on the walls of temple are gorgeous.",1
"Good to get some devotional light from Lord Krishna.

Well maintained, clean, Cleaner Air, Air Conditioned Venue. The only thing i didn't like it in this venue is there is no quicker exit after completing the prayers to Lord Krisha.

The exit is long, leading to shops setup by ISKON. You essentially gotta go through each and every shop before you exit.

More than a Temple, I got the feeling of being in a Supermarket built around a Temple.",1
This is one of the best temple I have visited go for premium darshan you can enjoy a lot pujas will be done as a group approximately 30 minutes it will take,1

Great place to visit and watch the devotees so much into Bhakti of Sri Krishna and also praying to other avatars etc. Is delight to watch and get involved in prayers. Must visit place in Bangalore.,1
"Iskon is more than a temple. It is in Rajaji nagar Bangalore. Situates 3km far from Yeshwantpur Bus station and railway station and 1.5km far from Soap factory Metro station. It is a temple and pilgrim center run by International Society of Krishna Consciouness. When you enter the premices the chat "" Hare rama Hare Krishna"" will fall in your ears.. it is on a small hill.. more than a temple here we got an exhibition center. Books store. A museum.. and you can shop few spiritual stuffs..
All toagather it is a wonderful place.",1
"ISKCON temple is very good, located in west of cord road, Rajajinagar, Bangalore. It in hill and the god Sri Krishna is very good.
Please visit this place.",0
"First of all you need to deposit your footwear at the ground floor. Then you have to cross the shopping centre to ultimately reach the temple which is at the top floor.
You will get all types of things relate dto lord krishna and also foood!
there is a 7d theatre, a restaurant, shopping amenities like gita and other lord krishna related books and various other things.
And the most interesting part is that to collect your shoes you need to go through all of these.
Quite a temple!!",0
"Krishna temples are always nice to visit, but here you get such a great experience by going up the hill, chanting hare krishna in 108 steps, worhiping, lord narasimha, sree venkateshwara swamy..and then sree krishna with balram, radha matha ..its such a great experience going up the hill.. worshiping.. and coming out.. you get such a delicious prasad too every time u visit the temple. ISKON also has restaurant for devotees who come for worship and then relax over weekend and in evenings. All food served are satvik (no garlic and no onion), very nice and delicious food. dont miss that experience too. u get good city view and metro train view too.. from top of the hill .. u wont regret going to this place.. even if u r not a krishna devotee..",1
"In Bangalore, Iscon temple is a place to be for visitors, the temple is nice and well maintained. The view from there also very good.",1
"Frankly, ISKCON doesn't need a review. Beautiful and very well managed temple with lot of open space. But, more than that, what is striking is the dedication of the volunteers to the cause. May be a bit tough to visit in special dates like Janmashtami but a visit during Kartika month is worth the effort. They celebrate something called deepotsava, which is worth witnessing.",0
"A nice Krishna tempel
Cud enjoy a complete session of a Krishna habits
Was interesting üôèüèΩ
To take pictures it was forbidden,",1
Modern temple present in Blore visited by thousands of people everyday. Temple looks very beautiful. The area is very big.,1
This place I feel is almost a must visit in Bangalore. It is an altogether a different and a good experience even if you an not really a follower of God.,1
"One of the beautiful tourist spots in Bangalore city. Once you claim the hill you get very good feeling of being in the beautiful temple, maintained cleanliness around the temple, and also mouth watering prasadams. On top of the hill, you can experience the good over view of the city around the Temple. A place to visit.",1
It was imagining i visited ISKCON with my family. I love the architecture and all arrangements and mostly delicious Prasadam.,0
"Nice place, good visit but its not as good as the original temple in WB. Food is also not that good but evening darshan is best time when arti happens",1
"It is a good place to visit if you travel to bangalore and while it is a temple , it has a big eat out place with lot of veg options so you can plan the sight seeing accccordingly to ensure you lunch or snack is also covered.",1
"The place has a nice religious ambience for Krishna devotees, but there is a commercial aspect to it if you would like to buy some of the Krishna memorabilias, religious materials. Teach the kids about the value of donation on their birthdays and make to see how such religious activities spread the value by free food for the needy and other uplifting activities performed with the help of donation. Just another experience and learning for the kids.",1
"This is a very ornate temple with the deities decked with gold and diamonds. You can see it from the Bangalore Metro. They check you thoroughly with metal detectors when you enter. Cameras are not allowed inside the temple. There is a gift shop offering various items for sale. Overall, worth a visit.",1
"This is more of commercial than religious... the view is beautiful. Usual hare krishna place.

Avoid this place during janmashtami as it will be too crowded.",0
This place is a master piece!! It's jus wow and the place is so silent and it's so divine and the god idols are such a beautiful creations and the place is so powerful for those who believe in God!!!,1
"The feeling of being blessed ! , it was a birthday visit for us , and were given the privilege of being right in front of the mesmerising statues of the gods , seeing every tiny detail of the beautiful Shringar , was worth it , The chanting and dancing of the lords name so strong that the vibration was felt to the soul ! ,I felt I was in heaven and the Lord was present in all my surrounding and more within me",1
"Very cleanly maintained and hygienic place, you can spend out any time in relaxing. Peaceful environment all around.",1
A good place to hangout in the evening with family . We were a group of six and had a pleasant evening .If you are an atheist better avoid,1
Beautiful temple in the heart of the city. Located near orion mall. You will find lot of shops to buy religious things within the temple premises. Worth a visit.,0
The temple is wonderfully built and its architecture and interiors are marvelous. The Prasad served is very tasty and wholesome. The only thing that I felt amiss is that the temple is too high and one has to walk a lot and climb many steps which is slightly distressful for aged people.,1
"Nice place!!

but it looked like more commercial place than religious
placehas amazing fast food options+ variety!!
finding a place to sit is a challenge on weekend",1
"Its a very calm and soothing place to spend time at. Even the lights look beautiful at night. The inner temple area is very peaceful, you would love to spend time over there.
The market that follows is a plus plus, you will get everything from books, idols to everything in food. The snacks were too tasty. Overall, its a good place to visit and spend time in.",1
"Devotion, Religion, Outing, Knowledge anything , even FOOD and Snacks whether prasadam or otherwise! Even a Huge variety of food stalls! You can spend the whole day here without getting bored!",1
"The place like all iskcons is well maintained and has beautifully adorned deities , however this is one of the biggest ISKCON temples I have seen. Nice experience and worth the time",1
"Wow. Peace can never be an exaggeration. You sit quietly inside the temple hall and just look at the magnanimity of the temple architecture all draped in marble. But the richness though does not take away the eloquence and the soul of the place.
And when you consider the meandering narrow road to the entrance of this temple, you can help but compare it with the hardships that we need to endure before we rise to meet the One.
There is enough car parking space atop the hill. The roads have been planned and well maintained here.
We had a great evening watching the city scape from this hill.",1
Iskon Temple Bangalore is must to see and very beautiful. For senior citizens you can avail temple provided facility i.e. auto facility for reaching temple and can use lift to reach main temple at 3rd floor,0
"Alongiwth religious, spirituality, place offers a lot for people to come together. can spent half a day with family or friends",1
"A nice divine place but converted into a commercial jail. To reach the GOD face to face is quite troublesome in the name of security and to get back to the car parking yard is even verse. After darshan of GOD, we have to pass though a fully commercial route like jail... I can't recommend this to anyone, even though I am a believer of Shree Krushna...",1
"It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world.The temple is a huge cultural complex that was inaugurated in 1997. There is a gold-plated dhwaja-stambha (56 ft) high and a gold plated kalash shikara (28 ft) high.

There is free distribution of Sri Krishna prasadam to all visitors during the darshana hours.During my visit I got veg pongal as prasadam and stamp size photo of Lord krishna.

ISKCON Bangalore has six shrines:

1.Radha-Krishna.
2.Krishna Balrama.
3.Nitai Gauranga (Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda).
4.Venkateswara
5.Prahlada Narasimha.
6.Srila Prabhupada.

The exit way after the Darshan from the main temple leads through a series of shops that offer books on Sri Krishna in all the possible Indian languages. Various shops which offer astonishing range of merchandise can also been seen giving away bags,pencils,compact discs,rings,cloths and many other things all having a mark or a photo of Sri Krishna.Apart from these things, there are various shops which provide eatables of large varieties including laddoo, cheese cake,samosa,milk shakes,pakoda,rice bath..... The overall view of these markets provide everything that a devotee visiting a temple would need.

Temple is very well maintained.
Must visit, multiple times.
Had a great experience
God bless
Hare krishna hare krishna. ......",1
Realy pleasent environment. Very calm inside the temple. Radha krishna statue inside the temple was realy superb. Gives a good relief to stress.,1
"A must watch temple in Bangalore in the city limits with good metro and bus connectivity, It is the best place for the people who love architecture the ceiling and the pillars are the must watch in the temple. A very peaceful place where u can have a quiet moment with yourself. Watching the aarti is such a pleasure that u almost start to dance along with the krisna bhaktas. The prasadams are something one should not miss. Also this is the main centre that is implementing Akshayapatra school meal scheme for students around Bangalore.
Definitely worth the time, and it would be best to visit in the evening around aarti time when the temple is lit up with the lights.",1
Peaceful place to visit and I like to spend time there. You can enjoy the metro as well nearby. Wonderfull expierience last time,1
The temple which is ever seen in my life.too good which is in Bangalore.i went with my family and i enjoyed a lot.everyone have to visit this temple.simply suberb and awesome.,1
I personally really didn't like my visit to the temple. They expect everyone to travel the entire display and sales area setup promoting their stuff. Please let our belief on Krishna or almighty away from your business,1
"Very nice temple. Well connected by metro and non ac bus. Need connectivity by ac buses too.
Iskcon is well organised. There are people to collect footwear and keep it safely.
The veiw from the top is amazing.",1
"Although the temple is relatively new, it is still a beautiful place to visit. Although I am not a Hindu, I felt welcomed here. The main temple is beautifully decorated in solid gold. The floors are marble. Because it is a practicing place of worship, you have to take your shoes and socks off to enter. If you are not wearing long pants (for men) you rent a wrap to cover your legs.",0
"For people who love to appreciate architecture , like to search for their soul is the right place . But the think I strongly disliked campaigning Indian Lord in Tiffin Box , Pencil Box etc . If we have build a huge temple for lord then why in cloths , cricket bat . bedsheet etc . Felt like Krishna Mall .",1
"One thing that strikes you, the moment you enter this temple is the enormity of the temple complex as well as the main temple size. You have to climb a lot of stairs to reach the main temple as well as pass through a couple of other smaller temples. The location of the temple is perfect. It is bang opposite the Sandal Soap factory and has become a landmark in itself. Close-by, you have the Orion Mall as well as the Sheraton Hotel. You have to pass through two security checks before you start the ascent to the temple. One at the entrance and the other after you deposit your bags and shoes. The entire system is very organized with volunteers and sevaks guiding you till you reach the top. The inner sanctum reverberates with the auspicious chants of ""Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare"". Listening to this chant, makes you feel at peace with yourself. After taking darshan of the Lord, you have to pass through a long route which is lined with the activities of the ISKCON group viz Books, Akshay Patra details etc. They also have a mini-theater which was showing animated films with respect to Lord Krishna. After darshan, you get prasadam which is generally a rice-based hot khicdi. Keep in mind that you will be allowed entry only if you are dressed in proper clothing. No shorts/three-fourths allowed for gents. Overall, you may spend approximately one hour in the temple premises with delays only during peak times like evening aartis.",0
"A great place to be in Bangalore.
Clean and well maintained temple
timings of the temple could be looked at",1
"I have been visiting ISKCON for a number of times in past 5 months. It is The Place for your weekends after having a hectic week from work. You find mental peace and a great ambiance with lots of devotees visiting the palace, yes I mean it when I say Palace, its none less than this.",1
A blessing for Shri Krishna disciples. Have been here couple of times. We get good prasad and also a decent food to eat. Huge statue of the god and goddess !,1
The ISKCON temple in Bangalore is maintained very well. Poojas and rituals are done in style and as per scriptures. Food on the campus is well prepared and tasty. The temple idols are very beautiful and well decorated. There are few rooms for ISKCON members to stay too but these rooms are to be booked well in advance. They also conduct several classes on Spiritual issues.,1
"ISKCON temples what they're we all know. What's different here. Well it's situated near to Orion Mall and Sheraton hotel. The well organised structure starts right when you enter it. From footwear counter to main temple complex all are well organised. First one gets to entrance with 108 petals where one is required to chant a mantra to reach entrance of temple. Alternate direct route is there from left too. First idol is of Narsingh God. After this is another idol and then you enter the main complex. The paintings on terrace and the chandelier is absolutely beautiful. The main idol of Krishna God is placed here. On exiting you'll be routed through their magazine section. While climbing down is a small tuckshop where one can buy sweets. Below this floor is beautiful carvings for different stages of human. Then again some shops. In next floor again some food stuff and shopping. In next floor again food stuff this time sweets like jalebi too. Then you'll see restaurant. Then there's exit.

In all really good temple with lots of food options for visitors.",1
We went to ISKCON on july with family. It is a lovely and peaceful place to visit with family. It's some long distance from the city. But it is super place,1
"When you enter in the temple you will definitely get the reason of visit.
It was so vibrant and full of positive energy when you pray and watch all activities inside temple.
I have seen and visited most of Iskcon Temples in India. It was pleasure to visit and get Darshan of Lord Krishna with my family.",0

The devotees at ISKON run the temple on a volunteer basis and very often people who have been in important positions and jobs have given up their material life to devote themselves to be volunteers in this organization.
Their free food Scheme called Akshayapatra delivers thousands of meals to needy children across different parts of Bangalore all managed by the devotees making it one of the biggest such endeavors in the world as it is run for 365 days a year without any break.",0

If in Bangalore make sure for once to be here for evening Shayana Arati (Around 8:00 pm) singing and dancing is nice. Good place to be with family.,1
"Very beautiful temple..
Evening aarti and palki is beautiful..
Must visit once..prasadam is also delicious",1
One of popular places in Bangalore. Very well located and connected by public transport. Food is also available. Need to walk 1-2 km inside the temple as the premises is too big. Better not to buy any thing from there as it will encourage the temple authority to run a business. Let is remain a holy place to visit rather than a shipping mall.,1
"One of the best places to visit in Bangalore.

You will love this temple and the god's statue. and best place to do a meditation in front of lord Krishna..

By seeing Krishna you will get mesmerized with him.. It's just an amazing feeling.

one should not miss this place, if you are visiting to bangalore..

Peace, breeze and pleasant atmosphere. It stands on Hare Krishna Hill in Mahalakshmi layout Bangalore.

The members/devotees of the temple have well behavior and so kind to response.",1

This is A very popular Temple in the heart of the city in Yeshwantpur-West of chord road junction. It can be reached by Metro or bus. Crowded most of the time but worth a visit.,1

"When you enter, you will find a old guy with long Tilak on his forehead. He is a good sales man. He will show you 3 different prasad scheme.

If you refuse to select anyone of that scheme then you have to go to general line, which will take 1-2hrs to reach main temple, up on hill.

But I had choose Rs.300 scheme, which offers you following things
1) 2 ladoos as prasad, which you can bring with you and can share with your family/frinds.

2) they will give you Rs.80 coupon. If you want to buy from bookstall then this will be use as redeem coupon on total bill.

3) you will be a part of Aarti.

4) You will be in VIP line. Which only take 20 min to reach main temple.

I was convinced by last point only all other are like accessories.

This was their business part.

Now when you enter to main temple, suddenly your behavior and mind will change. Atmosphere is pleasant. Photography is not allowed so ..

I liked thier Bhajans so instead of buying books I bought CDs for Bhajans .

I recommend to choose any offer of that sales man.",1
"Clean and Beautiful place with Peace.
Post darshan, we all directed towards IISC - one of the best collage campus.",1
"Good place to visit. That temple is maintained well. The members of the temple have well behavior. And the Prasad is awesome. Inside the temple, You can buy different types of sweet and the quality also good. And also can buy books from the stall about load Krishna and other goddesses.",1

Free prasad was a bonus with hot kitchidi.

"I visited this place on a weekend and my review might just be a little tainted due to the weekend rush.

I love temples and architecture. I like the serenity and the peace. But ISKCON temple was too crowded and I was left a little worked up.

It was a Saturday and I had visitors from another country interested in going to ISKCON so we planned and left Koramangala at 11.00am. By the time we reached the location it was nearing 2.30pm. I would blame this time laps on weekend rush. Then we went in to the temple from one side after buying the tickets. The structure was plain white. And it looked more plain and angular then the usual structural beauty of Indian temples.

We took the tour and I tried to absorb as much as i can but frankly speaking I was just waiting to leave due to the crowd. we finally managed to reach the place where they serve food. By the time we got out of the temple it was a tiring experience. May be next time I would go on a weekday, that might solve the crowd issue.",1

It has shrines to Lord Anjaneya, Garuda, Narasimha and Balaji, before you ascend to the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Krishna, featuring 3 individual shrines to various poses of Krishna in a large hall. Don't miss the handicrafts shop or the restaurants on your way out!",1
Iskcon temple is situated in one of the best and prime location of bengaluru. And in suburb of yeshwanthpur. And is maintained cleanly. And is bit crowded in weekend. Best time is to visit in morning times .,0
The place is so calm and very well maintained.. but the most important thing is it's a costliest place too. We enjoyed the place with all the stotras....,1
"Fine Temple. Well maintained. Excellent ambeince. Idols are more of north Indian style. Scenic view inside and outside the temple. Definitely a must see on the Bangalore list. Do not carry mobiles, cameras etc. Keep your bags etc in the car / reception.. You will spend minimum time with the deity and more at the shopping counters. It is designed to be so. But believe me, you have so much variety. Food is really gastronomic. If you are a veggie, you have a great range. Satvic food without onion and garlic. Even cabbage gobis look authentic. Ice creams etc. In full, more of food and shopping. U can shop for great pictures, wall hangings etc too. You have all ranges. Soulful music cds too. Parking and food pricey though. Metro connectivity is good",1
"This is one of the place to be if you want to experience ISCKON.
Lavish temple, i never belived such a big plance in Bangalore. Different experience for me. If you are on one day trip to bangalore dont miss this place",1
"if you have never been to ISKCON temple, this one is a must visit. For those who've been to ISKCON temples in other cities, you will be pleasantly surprised to visit the one in Bangalore.",0
"ISKCON Temple Bangalore is ideal for families who are visiting Bangalore - it is a must visit place, having access by steps or directly by road-there are lots of activities & it is recommended to review the time table available online.",1
"As I was walking through this temple premises, I was amazed and overawed at the amount of investment, hard work and dedication by some people, resulting in this great Krishna Temple. Every thing about this temple is nice which is a must visit place for any one who visits bangalore. The maintenance and upkeep is immaculate. Well trained organised devotees are there everywhere to guide us. The main deity Krishna with Radha is a delight to dharshan or see. Unlike the TRADITIONAL TEMPLES IN INDIA, MAINLY SOUTH INDIA , there are not many restrictions except that you should not enter with foot wear and Photography not allowed in the main sanctum. But to be very honest, I did not get the same vibrations here as I normally get in the traditional temples of South India. may be, I am wrong, I don't know. Or may be I looked at it as a tourist. There are so many counters inside selling many items connected with the temples, such as books, photos, dolls, sculptures, sweets, snacks and many more decorative items for house.",1
"ISKCON Bangalore is a multi-storied, huge temple. Similar to the other Hare Krishna temples, you will get to see mesmerizing depictions of Hindu gods & goddesses; the environment is filled with the Hare Krishna chants reverberating throughout the temple complex. The temple is generally quite crowded on weekends; you should plan ~2-2.5hrs to cover the temple. Do check out the timings of the temple before planning a visit. Arti at the temple is an amazing experience that you may not want to miss.
Prasad, and food, is delicious (like most ISKCON temples).",1
Surely not a temple of utmost devotional flavour ... Highly disappointed ... The temple concentrates more on their shopping area than on the devotional area ...,0
beautiful and peaceful place away from the city. good place to visit on weekends with family and friends,0
"We visited on a Saturday afternoon, so it was quite crowded. The main entrance to the temple is free, but they will try to heavily sell you on a VIP ticket that lets you bypass the lines. We opted for the free entrance and didn't have too much wait. Be prepared to have the correct attire...no shorts allowed. They will give you appropriate cover up if you do wear shorts, with the appropriate deposit. The main temple is quite ornate with the golden alter, and many devotees sitting on the floor in the middle of the temple reciting the Hare Krishna mantra. Once you exit the main temple, you will enter the highly commercialize maze of marketplace stalls and food vending...seeming endless at times. You'll exit the temple with a handout of a free bowl of hot food, which was actually quite tasty. Aside from the loudspeakers on a continuous loop of the mantra, it was an overall interesting experience in Indian culture...but clearly a money making site for the Hare Krishna.",1
"I live like 6/7 kms near it, so whenever I get a chance I visit it. Huge, efficient management, clean. Go in time for the aarti, evening 7pm. Sit and enjoy, join the prayers and singing. Tasty laddoo, and the bhog/prasad that they offer is also tasty.",1
"Nicely maintained temple, very good ambience and clean area, many food counters, great place to visit while in Bangalore",1
Otherworldly vibrations throuout the sanctuary. Over all excellent experience 2 eateries inside. Free annadana prasadam full dinners in evening. Kichdi prasadam constantly accessible,1
"A beautiful temple of Krishna..temples for all the avatars of Vishnu,the permanent broadcast of the chanting of 'HareRamaHareKrishna' makes one drawn towards God...marble steps, beautiful architecture,the paintings is all splendid.The way they allow the people to move in a proper way makes it very pleasant.The sanctum of the gods beautifully decorated.There are small stalls where one can buy sweets,prasad,etc all made in the temple kitchen! Plenty of divine books of Krishna are available in all languages, must buy are little Krishna t shirts Kurta's for kids,There are souvenirs to buy.usualy a good prasadam is given it's simple and tasty.There is a veg restaurant where food ,snacks are available.Ample parking space is available.One can become member and you get some special privileges like you can go for special pujas on yr birthday, anniversary etc.Outside the fountain etc all are well maintained.It takes a special form as evening approaches,the lights etc gives it a magical mystical divine feeling!.",1
"Must visit place in Bangalore visit, good place to visit with parents and relatives.
Very calm and clean temple maintained by westerns, you will listen chants of Hare krishna hare rama all over the temple.
The prasada is very tasty specially that Pongal, you have some shops for shopping and you will get different kinds of food stalls.

I started visiting this temple from 2010.",1
Changing face of Hindu worship. The Hare Krishna movement is well known. They are also doing laudable charitable work. But not something for people who are interested in historic old temples.,1
"Wonderful time to spend our important days like my daughters birthday as well as our wedding day... great occassion with great place to celebrate this with Lord Krishna's blessings !!!
Prasad of Krishna -- No Match - it was excellant",0
"Will not compare it with other Iskons but you can visit this place with family.
The food lane after temple visit is tempting. Also prasada offered is also pretty decent.
All in all you can visit this when your parents and relatives are in town",0
"This is a great temple run by Westerners who are true believers in Hindu deity.
It clean neat peaceful good place to mediate or just sit there",0
"If you are looking to go for an outing with family to a decent place this is a place. Traditional ambience, temple on top and ample things to eat. Its more of a place to spend some quality time.",1
"Iskcon temples are there in most part of India. Having been to most of the Iskcon temples in India, bangalore one's is with a big space and very well maintained. Very peaceful and organised.",0
"This temple is managed well. We have the idols of Lord Narasimha, Lord Krisha, Radha and Balaram. This is a spiritual center where awareness is being created on lord Krishna. They sell varieites of books and memorablia inside the temple. You can also buy prasad. They have a fantastic satvik resturant inside the premises where vegetarian food is served. ISKON under a scheme called Akshara Patra, feed millions of school children with hot mid day meal across the country.",1
"peace of mind , a very catchy presentation , attractive lighting, lots of people ,full of crowd. really awesome",1
Experienced a superb Darshan in all the Mandir. The atmosphere was electrifying & joyous. Beautiful way took spend quality time with family.,1
"While the cleanliness of this entire hillock temple is unbelievable but true, the systems they follow are very good and not akin to what the regular south indian temples follow.
Nevertheless, the returns - ie the poeace of mind is amazing.
Great structures with pindroip silence stills ones mind.
They also distribute deity's prasadams and supported by a dedicated vegeterian canteen food..
A must see for any new comer to Bangalore.",1
The temple is magnificent and reverberating with the people's chants of hare ram hare ram ram ram hare hare hare Krishna hare Krishna Krishna Krishna hare hare.,1
ISKCON Temple bangalore is a Gr8 place and a must see. Food there is good and nice place for meditation.,1
excellent place visit in Bangalore. however place will be crowded but not much. get to see lord krishna. lots of varieties of snacks just before exit of the temple.,1
"This is a nice big modern temple.
Nothing impressive and feels like to commercial.
I spent here 30 min and got the idea.
Go to the Bull temple instead.",0
"Very well organised, trouble free darshan, Gifts shops are abundant with religious gifts & books. Prasadam stalls are filled with mouth watering varieties...",1
"Hi reader, thought of sharing my experience with you on this popular place of visit in Bangalore. What I like most about it is that you get a good feeling when u are here. The bhajans and the aarti are a must attend. Some times they have additional programs which are really awesome. So check the website to learn about those. Be there once if you are in Bangalore. The Prasadam they serve is very good.",1
"The temple rules are extremely strict and it really isn't worth the hassle, particularly if you have seen an ISKCON temple before. No shoes, no cameras, no phones and no bags, and each has to be checked in and out separately. The bureaucracy was ridiculous. Inside, it was the same old stuff as I saw in the last ISKCON temple but with more things for sale. Give it a miss!",1
"For typical experience of Hindu temple festivities with several activities going on all around you. Bhajans, Darshana of deities, Pooja, meditation, spiritual audio, books ,pictures incense colourful idols sales, vast varieties of food offered as Prasad of the Lord. Multitude of people from all parts of India. There is a ordinary restaurant and an upmarket restaurant serving sattvic food with devotional music. Great location on a small hillock with ample parking space. Nice colourful fountains and well lit pathways. Overall a wonderful experience !",1
"If you are coming to enjoy than it's a right place . It's more like a shop, Didn't imbibe any devotion in me.",0
"Very systematic in their approach to the process in the temple, so it was easy and comfortable for visitors like us. A variety of Veg food available. Quite neat and well maintained.",1
"ISKCON Hare Krishna temple in Rajajinagar is a must visit place for the spirituals.Immerse yourself in the mantra chanting in the main temple.The unique way of putting God to sleep at 8.15 PM is a must,great experience.Great delicacies too in their Kitchen,though it may take away from the feeling of a Temple.",0
It is good and serenity visit place is very nice the feeling is divine the crowd is decent when you enter in you feel not to come out,0
"It's ridiculous that people are busy selling you books and clothes and Bhagwan items at every nook and corner of the temple. The temple is designed in such a way that one has to exit through a long market place thus giving the sellers enough time and space to milk customers. Ridiculous

Only positive is the restaurant there which has very good food but even that is not light on your pocket. Rates than can easily match a decent 4 star restaurant. People get swayed by the fact that it is chappan bhog and all that non sense when it is ultimately just food. Don't think I will ever repeat it unless I have no option",1
"i visited the temple on my birthday. Since i am one of the patrons, they send an invitation one week before hand. They confirm over telephone a day earlier whether i will be visiting in morning or evening. i am allowed persons. This year only 4 of our family visited.
We reached the main temple though a lift. Wheel chair facility is also available. Promptly the securities or the reception persons help you out. One of the swamijis welcome you at the temple. Notice is put that next puja will be at 7:1 am. Till then they make you sit comfortably - even on chairs - and chant here rama here rama, rama rama here here, here krishna here krishna, krishna krishna here here with a japamala. Sharp at 7:15, swamiji takes you in front, 3 pujaris come and do the ceremonial waking up of the deities. The same swamiji guides you to Lords Narashima and Govinda temples to do the puja. Again at main temple special puja and archana is done for all the families of birthday devotee together. Not only theertha is given, you are given water to wash hands and a towel to wipe. Great. Then they guide you to the dining hall for heavy breakfast. The swamijis make you chant loudly before breakfast. Though coffee is not served, they serve hot badam milk. Everything minute to minute punctually done and guided silently - no shouting - no pushing. Peaceful atmosphere. The workers were wiping the few drizzle drops so that we don't slip in the marble floor.",1
The temple atmosphere is serene giving one a surrounding to meditate. The administration is so good it ensures smooth flow of pilgrims / visitors even when there is heavy rush with a nice arrangement for leaving behind shoes / other footwear. Spending a major portion of the visit in the main temple being one with the deity with bhajans in his praise was an exhilarating experience. An excellent place to visit for the entire family including children. There is a good restaurant besides the temple providing free prasad in the afternoon which was excellent. Take a water bottle along.,1
"Nice Temple of Krishna on the hill top with nice view of bangalore skyline, with too much crowd during weekends But crowd is controlled nicely so that there is no rush at any place, but only thing dont like is too many shops inside the temple complex through which you have to pass through whether you like or not,",1

This temple stands out significantly around the environment attracting every one to enter and have a darshan od Lord Krishna and his consort Radha. You will have a grand view from atop the steps leading to the main hall where the statues are very beautifully decorated. You can sit in the hall and meditate and pray calmly immersing yourself in the divine presence.,1
It was a wonderful experience visiting the temple. However waiting time is too much as there are long ques.,1

A look from outside suggest a 'big crowd' but the crowd control and management handles the situation so well it is very much visitable even on a festival day like Diwali , Janmashtami and Vaikunta Ekadasi . It is ensured that every visitor gets his share of testy Prasad with out hastle. If you wish to have your meal, there are vegetarian restaurants inside to meet every taste and pocket. Visit to temple is not complete with out a visit to their 'kitchen' that cooks and supplies mid day meal for lakhs of school going children in and around the city of Bangalore. In simple terms, it is a Hindu temple that works with army precision and cleanliness of a Hospital without loosing its serenity.",1
"This is one of the cleanest temple I have seen. The Arti was mind boggling!!! The snacks and food on the way down - arranged in small stall like set up - was just superb...... Packed some sweets and snacks from there and had dinner at their ""Higher taste restaurant"". The restaurant has 4 star level set up..... Served pure vegetarian ang (Higher) tastry food....... Enjoyed every bit of it. A model which many temples in India should follow...",1

"Though there is nothing much to see in Bangalore, but ISKCON temple is really a charm to see. The beautiful designs of temple, statues and pavements are must see",1
"A good place to visit, bit crowded over the weekend. You can spend 2-3 hours easily. Felt that it has turned more towards commercial side. Worth a visit once.",1
It's a nice temple to visit. I have been there couple of time. I suggest to visit late evening and stay till Aarti. They do awesome Aarti with Hare Krishna hare Rama chant everywhere. Only part I don't like is it is highly commercialised but then at least no one pushes you to buy any stuff out there.,1
Will relax your mind. Visit after 6pm. Lightning and ambiance is amazing. Hyms are relaxing. Expect good food.,1
"Its a long flight of steps after you enter the gates of the temple till you can get ""Darshan"" but it is so worth it! The premises and the main temple area - all of it is spotlessly clean and managed to perfection. The feeling/experience is indeed deeply spiritual and touches the soul. As you are listening to the kirtan, you wonder what could be more to life than the blessings of the Almighty...",0
"If you believe in lord Krishna then a must visit the place, the chanting and festive seasons are really mesmerising. I just don't like the commercialization part of the temple. But I avoid that and enjoy the rest.",1
This temple is nice and has good architecture. You get a very soothing feeling when you visit. You feel so relaxed...,1
Good to visit once..highly commercialize and crowded..very clean and excellently manage..it's good for outing....,1
"This is one of the ISKON temples, but unlike other ISKON's you can pay here for VIP darshan. However it's not required if you are visiting on weedays or non festival day. Temple is clean. They say you should chant lord Krishna's names 108 times here. What I saw was that the people who came there were more interested in the canteen rather than the darshan
The canteen serves scrumptuous north indian delicacies like Jalebi, gulab jamun, rasgulla. And you have to buy that",1
This place attracts devotees from the entire world. i see a lot of foreigners visiting this place. The food court sells the best sweets and also the best egg less cake. This place is best to visit in the evening.,1
"It is first place to visit in bangalore, though it is temple, the place in the temple makes u really pleasant . From there you could visit Orion mall too.",1
"Beautiful temple- very nice, clean, and serene, Good concept of steps leading to the main temple. For each step, you should chant the mantra.. A positive vibe of Spiritual vibrations all around the temple. There is a restaurant restaurant inside.",1
"Temple is in yeshwantpur ! Good place for calm , peace, relax tension free etc. visit one times .

Good luck !",1
Facilities are good and you can enjoy Puja and Aarti especially in the evening time.Had a great experience to watch.,0
this temple has become one of the landmarks of bengaluru. visit it to be overcome with inner peace and satisfation . only thing i dont like is the commercial section which is overpriced and for-profit. but kudos to iscon for promoting spiritual awareness,1
"Neatly maintained and organised temple, must visit for everyone in bangalore , located in heart of city so commute is easy",1
The temple is very very good and clean... The system of arrangements were perfect... We can buy bhagvathgeetha in all languages... Nice place to visit...,1

The security checks, railings for the separation of the queue, the shoe stands and everything else in the temple is very well organised.

Its a must visit place in Bangalore city. Especially very nice for its architecture. The place is very calm and devotional.,1
located in the middle of a busy area the temple is very calm and quite once we enter it is a really peaceful place to be one with god very refreshing the variety of snacks available inside is also good,1
Well maintained. nice to see the lights at night time.the place is quite far from old airport road. But truly everyone will like it.,1
Actually we went this place after visiting Mayapur ISCON twice and after that grandeur experience in MAYAPUR we find this is a mere average. But I feel if someone didn't visit the MAYAPUR ISCON he/she'll enjoy!,0
"The Indian Society of Krishna Consciousness has built this magnificent edifice on a hillside .Thousands of pilgrims visit the temple,walk up the steps praying all the while as the need succour from their day to day problems.As they ascend and pass through the portal to the sanctum sanctorium they hear the music of the devotees singing paens to the Lord.A ""darshan "" or view later they descend through a number of commercial establishments as the Indian tradition of buying a keepsake in a temple prevails.All devotees are treated to a free meal while exiting the temple and vegetarian meals are provided to lakhs of people every day.The ISKCON group also provides free midday means to poor school children as part of their Corporate social responsibility.A Noble cause indeed.",1
This is a place to go for whenever you have guests from different town. The temple is marvellous and environment completely peaceful. I even enjoy the Prasad counters and variety of food available.,1
Must visit place in Bangalore. Don't miss the temple look from outside in lights after 6-7PM. Bit negative is it will look commercial once completed the krishna Darshan and entered to shopping area.,1
"The Krishna temple is a nice good, calm and peaceful place. The hare ram chant by the people brings the divinity and makes you feel happy. This is a must visit place if you are in Bangalore",1

This place is very good and the temple of Radha Krishna is one thing you will want to visit in Bangalore. It is a great place to start your weekend and enjoy roaming around.,1
"The atmosphere transports us to the spiritual realm just with the purity in the environment. It has cleanliness, hygiene, friendly inmates, delicious delicacies and soul stirring praises. Best day and time to visit: Sunday 7 AM.",1
This temple is worth a visit .being from a different religion i was amazed to see the passion with which people worshipped here with dhol n chants,1
"We are life members of ISKCON and visit this beautiful temple regularly. A very peaceful place to worship for Lord Krishna Worshipers and others who want to have a glimpse of Hindu religion. The Restaurant Higher Taste offers best vegetarian food (buffet with over 50 dishes, live counter at Rs. 350) anywhere in the world. For those on budget, there is plenty of free food and low cost restaurant where a Thali (plate) of food is available for Rs. 70 (One US Dollar). Very clean and hygienic place.",1
"I was lucky to come to visit early on a non crowded day. Queues can be very long, so take care. The visitor circuit has short cuts but it costs more (when you pay, god is nearer....). We paid 1000 INR for up to 6 persons, same price when you are only 3.
The best time of the visit is when you reach the top room with the altair plated with gold. But coming up the stairs is worth the view.
It is a pity that the architecture has not been protected to add extensions that look really strange.
The blessing and (if you want) the time spent singing with other visitors and pilgrims 'Hare Krishna' is an experience worth to live.
Unfortunately, afterwards, you have to go cross a series of shops that make you feel sorry.
Nevertheless, it is worth a visit.
Be careful when it rains, you have to be bare foot and the soil is slippery.",1
"I have never been so disappointed by visiting any temple in my life. You need to pay to get inside, then buy books, then buy goodies and buy more goodies, buy food and eat, buy posters and keep buying. Nearly a kilometer of walk is next to shops within the temple",1
Visited on Sunday evening with family. For sure must place to visit in case you are spiritual. Avoid going on Sun evening as we had to stand in line for more than 30 mins and it's not easy for senior citizens considering that there are many steps as well.,1
Very fancy and beautiful temple. Top level is the temple and the bottom level is the food and giftshop.,1
Built in 1997... The temple has become an Ingram part of the city. The architecture is worth a see even if you are not religious per se. It is located in the northern part of bangalore in rajahs Nagar.,1
I went on school days. it was wonder kovil i had never seen before. neet and clean. when u go there u mind was fully refreshed. i like it very much. if u bangalore don't forget to go iskcon temple.,1
Great place and the temples are very well maintained. It is on a hill top and offers great view of Yeshvantpur/Bengaluru. We went there in the morning so could not see the light section. The prasad offered was hot and very tasty.,1

"One of the best temples in Bangalore.. you dream a modern temple and it gives you that. This temple is not traditional, it is more of sophisticated and provide all possible easy to everyone. Since in India temples are seen with very high regard and lot of people visit to one has to go through very huge line to reach to God's statue. It is one of the tourists attaction place in Bangalore so crowd is always there. On special occasions, which are too often in this country, the crowd is even more. Its not only the temple but a nice shoping place where u can buy any Hindu stuffs and sweets.. you need to pay reasonably good prices for all. You do get free prasad also. The only place in temple I found Pizza.. basically I like this place as it has all modern likings in spiritual form.. good to take kids as they will not dislike and may feel temple is also a place to go..so you can introduce God much better way. God's statues are beautiful and well decorated all the time.. bhajans are always around.. must visit place in Bangalore.",1

Very recommended--- :)",1

The food options is as good as any good sweet shop (with same price although). You can take the special pass for quicker access to darshans.",1
This is very nice place to visit. The management to place your valuable things as well as your shoes is very good. This facility is paid but at very cheap price. Shorts are not allowed in this temple but they provides traditional cloth for entering in temple. The Special DARSHAN is paid. There are many things are available to buy in the premises of the temple.,1
"This temple is situated at a height and a place for really a great view of Bangalore. Temple ambience is really great like other ISKCON temples and the same with Lord Krishna Idol.
Eateries at end are also mouth watering and in well hygienic conditions.",1
I found this place full of energy and interest. There were many people there going thru the temple. I was very happy to have a hotel guide who knew the route. We got the most expensive ticket and were able to go thru special lines to get to the top temple where we were able to sit on the floor and be blessed. The sights and sounds were comforting and interesting. (very different than temples in Japan).,0
It is one finest place in bangalore to visit and stay there for some time with family and friends i visited this last Sri krishna's Birthday i am planning to go there for this year also,1

A must visit place for locals and tourists in Bangalore. The place offers utmost peace and tranquility in all corners and not just in the main temple arena. Iskon has been spearheading Krishna consciousness movement globally and this Temple is just a sheer magical place to witness all their endeavors.,1
Very nice and well maintained temple. A must visit temple in Bengaluru. Its is placed in top of hill and morning pooja view is amazing.,1
"I have been to this place even during my college days. This time I went along my in laws. No doubt you will find crowd here almost any time during the week. The campus is clean and well maintained. You have allowed place for keeping your Footwear so that is something, you are not gonna lose on return.
The temple is huge specially the Krishna Radha temple. Once you will enter the temple, your thoughts can dive in the divine surrounding or can go rational.
I am a devotee but here I feel another aspect of devotion. With all due respect, I prefer this place as a visit spot and not very much as temple. You have shopping area, food Court inside the premises. You will also meet temple priest who will teach you the way to please God.
Well everyone has their own definition of God and devotion and so have mine. A good place to be with family without any concern.
But you go there.. Do not miss the morning Aarti and the Prasadam they give to all the devotees. Prefer that preparation rather than buying sweets on the name of Prasadam just to avoid queue and crowd.
Always remember God never charge you for his blessings but human does for their service.",1
"Very nice temple to visit, though one has to go through a series of stairs , worth the walk. The temple timing in the evening is upto 8:30pm. But fortunately I could enter the temple around that time and was able to see the closing ceremony for the day.
Very peaceful and people were dancing without any inhibition and chatting "" Hare Rama Hare Krishna""................................great experience....will go again when ever possible.
Ya good food court once you come out of the temple.........they call is Prasadam, we have to buy and choose from the different delicacies available. Toilets were also well kept.",1
"I'm a Japanese living in India.
I'm not Hindu, I like this place.
Looks beautiful and peaceful at the same time.
It teaches me several things about their belief. I can buy good souvenirs in that area.

Nice.

I appreciate it.",1
Very nice and well maintained temple. A must visit temple in bengaluru. Aarti in evening is mesmerizing.,0
"Loved this place.. so big, quiet and peaceful.. I could spend there all day and not have enough. Not only looks really beautiful but its also quiet interesting, even if you are not so interested (or you don't know so much about the culture) you will like the place. You can learn something when you go there.. When i came there was some ritual happening (can't tell what it was).
When you enter you have to leave your shoes at the door. Also I couldn't take my camera inside. But it didn't bother me and allowed to focus on the whole experience.

I am still not sure if this place is free or no.. someone sold me a ticket for a prayer or a talk with one of the masters in the temple. I think it wasn't necessary to enter, however it wasn't expensive and I was glad that I could donate something for this place.

There is also a place in the temple where you can get food and drinks.",0
"The ISKON temple is definitely worth a visit. Sitting atop a hill, the architecture is an interesting blend of the modern and traditional. You climb a series of stairs and once you enter the sanctum, it's a beautiful sight to behold. There are beautiful painting from the Bhagwatgita and you can spend time admiring these or in contemplation. Once you leave the space and get to the exit, you are unfortunately hit by a relentless array of shopping and food, which I felt was a little too excessive; but the fact that the funds are generated for the upkeep and the numerous charity projects, is probably a reasonable reason to excuse the same.

On premises is also the Higher Taste restaurant, which specializes in Satvik vegetarian and is recommended",1
"Must visit place in Bangalore, maintenance is very good. Less space for parking.
Whenever i visit i wait for parking.
After shrine visit lot of things for shopping and snacks, varieties of snacks are available.
Free lunch also provided between 11:00 to 14:00 hrs.",1
Peaceful Temple and well maintained.....have also attended some of their programs for youth and found they are mind blowing. The program presents many articles for the benifit of this human race.,1
"Beautiful temple of Lord Krishna on top of a rocky hillock. Just a few years back it was a stony hillock of hard granite.

Books on religion in English and other Indian languages are sold.The discourse on Bhagavatgita by hon. Bhaktivedanta is available. The roof of the main hall is so beautifully painted with scenes of life of Lord Krishna. The idols are made of gold and decorated with diamonds and precious stones, are very beautiful.

Peace prevails at the temple and added to that is the Blessings of the Lord Krishna , Balaji & Narasimha . The best part of the temple is you cannot take your eyes of the Lord , so captivating",1
I frequently visit ISKCON temple which located in North Bangalore. Must visit the temple at least once whoever worship Lord Krishna. You feel peaceful and blessed as soon as entered the temple.,1
"The temple is very well maintained and it has enough parking space. But we need to visit this place with fat wallets. From the time you enter until you leave, there will be people trying to sell all kinds of things. You will see books, posters, toys, clothes, variety of food etc etc. To me it is less of a worship place and more of a tourist place. Nevertheless a beautiful place to visit",1
"Temple of Krishna - Radha. Very clean and well organised. Most emphasis on promoting the Krishna consciousness. Built on a small hill, the view is amazing. You could spend of 2-3hrs sitting & watching the beauty of construction or sit inside the main temple in chanting the Krishna mantras.",1
"a modern architectural and spiritual abode of GOD with the devotees experiencing shopping , eating places and of course the prasadam. there is choice of fine dining etc. within the complex .

"The Iskcon Temple is one such site that people coming to Bangalore wish to visit. The temple is very organised and constructed to manage a huge crowd. The decoration, grandeur and stories related to the temple add to its qualities. The Aarti is the most awaited and popular activity that needs to be witnessed. The prasadam is very delicious and you cannot stop yourself from trying some awesome delicacies in the canteen. I would suggest people to not miss the Plum Cake. Its the best one in bangalore that i have noticed.",1
"This is a very religious and crowded place. A temple for devotees of Krishna, you'll find a lot of checking at the entrance and some very strict rules. Cameras are not allowed, nor carry bags and cellphones, which have to be left at the entrance.
The best part is probably the main golden shrine of Krishna and Radha inside the mandir where bhajans and dances animate the visit.
You will find bookshops, sweet stalls and also ""prasadam"" at the exit.

We didn't really feel a good vibe being constricted in following so many rules, I expected to visit a temple and felt like we were going through an airport checking before boarding.... Better visit a temple next time.",1
"Maintenance of the temple is excellent, the place is very clean and everything is well organised. After you complete the mandatory security check, you climb the steps to enter into the queue for the darshan.One of the finest and beautiful place in the Hare Krishna world. Metro station is very close to this place. Suggest to visit in weekdays than in weekend due to tourists and local crowd. Don't miss Hanuman temple which is close by this place but the other side of the road.",1

"Since I entered into the temple, I could find this temple is totally commercially oriented. However, The temple is huge and well maintained. Initially, they will take 2 Rs. from you for keeping your footwear. Next, you will see big banners for the prices for different prayer offerings. It is designed in a way that you have to go to special line with some extra payment. Even the exit path is full of commercial shops. Undoubtedly, Its a great temple with calm environment. But the commercial things are too much.",1
It was a great experience to be the part folklore team In iskcon and I thoroughly enjoyed the day at iskcon participating in bajan and chanting the maha mantra . Awesome feel to participate in evening arthana,1
"This beautiful Temple of Lord Krishna is situated on a hill near Rajajinagar a suburb in Bengaluru.This very well maintained Temple is the star attraction for Krishna devotees. Climbing the steps to reach the Temple maybe tiresome for aged people but we get to see the view of the city. The idols of Radha, Madhav (Krishna ) are awesome and the decorations are beautiful.The aarti ritual is ""Icing on the cake"", a Divine experience. The ambience inside is spiritual..The prasadam is delicious. ISKON is connected with the Akshaya Patra a noble cause, where they feed needy children. This place is well connected. We can buy spiritual Holy books like The Bhagavad-Gita, The Ramayana and the Mahabharata, also fine pictures of Krishna. We got small picture ofBala Krishna as free gift. Don't ever miss the opportunity, do to visit the Temple.",1
"Excellent surroundings , making it as one of best temples of BANGALORE.A must visit for visitors from Bangalore and outside as well.A great holy place wilth lot of worship like ambience and atmosphere.",1
"Staying in Bangalore since birth, I had never visited ISKCON temple. It was my first visit in 2015 that left me staggered.

The place is no doubt too huge, well-maintained and calm. But what surprised me was the big display board with the prices for some offerings or prayers, the loooong queue which we could happily escape by entering from in-between through some influence which my friend had and most importantly the exit way in the building which is filled with shops selling eateries, books, CDs and other stuffs.

One might feel that all the things I mentioned above will be there in most of the temples, why exaggerate for ISKCON, again, it's what I felt when I visited and purely my opinion. So you might or might not feel this as commercialized temple.

The God's idol/statute is not in the south-Indian style but is that of North-Indian style, i.e, the white idols. The hall is huge and nice.

One thing that you shouldn't miss when you go to this place is to have food at 'Higher Taste'. It serves pure jain food and taste justifies the name of the restaurant.",0
"The temple is one of the finest and bit latest attraction in Bangalore.Known for modern architecture,clean interiors and serene calmness adds to the delight of the tourist. Has ample parking facility inside the temple .The priests speak excellent English,very helpful.Photo and videography prohibited.",0

"A great holy place. The temple is dedicated to lord Krishna. The atmosphere is good & pure would make you feel so good. Everybody is just singing the lord krishna songs, The arti is something must to watch & the prasad is also great. A peaceful place.",1
Pleasant atmosphere. Feels great to see. Must watch in bangalore. My guess is best iskcon temple in South India,1
"This is a place where I usually take my guests to. Perched on a hillock, and a large stretch, this place has a beautiful temple and is well maintained, attracts many visitors round the year. They also offer excellent food, agarbattis and pictures and idols. Higher taste is a veg fine dining restaurant with in the premises.
Janam Ashtami (Lord Krishna's Birthday) is an occasion one should definitely visit this temple on to see the decoration and festivity.",1

"The temple of Iskcon are always nice to visit and chanting of Hare Krsna is worth hearing in your ears. They shall restrict food areas, which is a real mess.",1
Truly a blessing to go here every single time....the divinity just flows and embraces you...and to realise that the Akshay Patra scheme one of the most unique initiative to feed school children mid day meals in thousands and to contribute is so gratifying.giving something back to the needy..that's god in itself...hare Rama hare Rama Rama Rama hare hare hare Krishna hare Krishna... Krishna Krishna hare hare.,1
This place is like heaven. the architecture is so mind blowing. the view at night is so overwhelming.,1
"The whole expirence was great. The people of the temple are so friendly, helpful and have so much time to explain what is going off. I was there about 2.5 hours and had dinner all in the price of the ticket 300 rupees",1
Its a nice place and flocked by a lot of devotees. They have a lot of religious material for the devotees and even others.,1
When i came to bangalore this is the first place which i visited and its worth comming. Very nice temple with simplicity. Have metro station nearby all transport accessible. And as all iscon temple it is also one of the classic temple.,1
"Good temple, located near metro station, have to walk and climb a lot of stairs to reach the main temple at the top, the whole structure is well organized to avoid stampedes or rush, nice shops inside however quite costly items which can be bought from outside as well at reasonable rates.",0
"Located in Yeshwantpur , it is a beautiful Krishna temple . Have been there twice. You can buy religious book like Geeta, Ramayana inside .Apart from that there are shops which sells all religious stuffs.",0

Parking facility
Varieties of vegetarian food available
Great scenic view of Bangalore
You can do offerings to god

Cons:
Wear religious dresses.
I heard they dont allow lungis, shorts, leggings, modern wears
Crowded during religious important days and weekends

Not for:
This religious place is not for hangout, time-passers
No-nonsense people

Surrounded by:
Great transportation, accessibility, great to reach
Movie halls, Malls, shopping places, eateries",1
I went along with my family and it is good place to spend time in evenings . Interior is beautiful and feels good. There are lot of shops for snacks and buy stuffs.,1
The queue is huge that makes visit uncomfortable. Architecture is good. You can enjoy the prasad served there,1
"Beauty is u cant see much from outside that whats gonna be inside but when u goo inside it .. ohhh its too gud... as u get in with each step ahead u have to say ""HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA, KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE"".. will love it.. not for hangouts but for once must visit...",1
"This is an interesting place to visit and well worth the trip. Take care not to turn up in shorts as my colleague did as the provided leg covering is not to everyone's taste.

Interesting and very VERY busy",1
"As everybody knows, this is a very famous temple in Bangalore with Shri Lord Krishna as the main deity. The construction of this temple on a hill kind, is really admirable. One should visit this temple at night before 8:30 to have a spiritual peace of mind.",1
"Huge and very impressive temple high up in Bangalore. Don't take a camera or wear shorts - as you'll be pulled out of line and dressed in a dhoti. Temple was busy when we went, just as it opened in the afternoon, queues quite long, but worth the wait.",1
"If you are looking for a temple to pray and to induce some peace to your mind, this is not the right place. This is more like a shopping mall with items in the brand of shiva.",1
"Came from Night shift..As the sun rises headed over to the Temple!
Once u reach temple..who feel the positive energy..When the temple opens with the chanting of Lord Ram feels like all the negative energy changes into Positive! Must visit place when you are in Bangalore without Miss",1
"We stay very near to the ISKCON temple and have visited here a number of times with the guests who come to our house. This is a Krishna temple, on a small hillock, which is one of the star attractions in Bangalore. The decorations around the main deity is amazing and you can sit down for some time leisurely. This is not like any other typical temple, where we can offer flowers and perform 'Abhishek'. What was really amazing was the amount of snacks (including cake) which was available after you finish all the darshan. There are a number of stairs, which the elderly persons should take care. If you have a car, then you can drive inside the temple to the top. Lot of crowd during the 'Ekadashi' day. Half a kilometre from ISKCON, there is a beautiful Hanuman temple, which is worth visiting.",1
I have seen less temple complexes which are clean and organized and this is one of them. You can get blessed by Krishna and also feel the vibes all over with lovely chants .I also had some short eats in there food court which were also excellent.,1
"A very nice temple, more like on a small hillock. As you enter, you can feel the vibration / sanctity; After a great darshan, you will come across various handicraft / ISCKON related items, followed by mouth watering in house made dishes for Vegetarians... Don't miss, if you time...",1
"really i love to pray krishna, bcz he is the one of my favourite god in traditionally quoted. and i will be visit iskon temple again and again.",1
"Hill temple, located near to WTC (world trade centre) in bangalore. The Lord krishna and the godess statue is made of gold. Nice place to visit.",1
"Magnificient temple with amazing Sringar. Also has Govinda and Narshimha temple. They offer tasty prasad as well.

One can also buy a variety of snacks on exit of temple, made with out Garlic/Onion.",1
its ossam movement in life to visit ISKCON TEMPLE IN BANGALORE.....this is very interesting place and ossam...everyone wanna visit this place,1
away from the city crowd and wonderful and peaceful place to spend time with family holistically. you get food there and there are many stuffs and eateries to have and have fun with family.,1
"one of the beautiful temple in bangalore, its just like heaven inside the temple everyone chanting mantras of lord krishna and i loved the visit.",0
"I visit this temple twice - once on my business trip and during a family tour, both during the evening aarti. The atmosphere is serene, the place is beautifully constructed & decorated. The ambience inside the temple is spiritual with lots of devotees from all over the world. They served the best sweet jaggery prasadam.",0
This is very silent place and good temple.. family should visit.. I visited so many times and liked this. You can have peaceful environment.. I would recommend this for everyone. All the services and systems are really good.,0
"If you're a traditional religious person, this modern cult temple may seem like a well-maintained museum to you. But go with open mind, and this is a nice, clean, beautiful shrine on its own. At any rate, this Rajajinagar mandir is worth a visit.",1
"A serene and spiritual place which is well maintained as well. If you are visiting, I would suggest that u take the 300 rupees coupon to enter which gives u quick access to different areas of the temple and also gets u a few sweets. There are a lot of eatables and souvenirs available in the temple premises to purchase. I loved the trip but i couldn't help but feel that the whole place is a bit monetized. I tried to give 100 rupees as a donation but they apparently accept only 1000 rupee donations which is not something i have seen in temples.",1
"As a family we visited Iskon temple when we had our relatives from Chennai. Iskon, besides a temple, is also a major tourist spot in Bangalore, considering its grandeur. It has a divine aura with devotional music being played in the background. The food court that serves pure Satwik dishes is made in the most hygenic manner. Our large group comprising of mixed age memberd had a very satisfying visit to the body, and more to the soul..",1
The temple very nice and calm place. You can go there and relax and do meditation. If you are visiting Bangalore and do visit the temple.,1
"very calm n cool place, nice prasad and very high quality food available but now it has becomes full professional as you have to go thru those narrow lanes and forcefully have to go to all places on the route to main deity....if you are in hurry and only want to go to main deity you cannot.....",0
"ISKCON, a temple, once entered, gives you a whole new experience. The peace you get with-in is priceless. Just stay there for some time and believe me, you would forget all your stress.",1
"There is something unique about the concept of Darshan. When we go to temples we go so that we can see the Lord and for him to see us. The sight of our dear Lord purifies us, strengthens us, brings us closer to Him. Sri Krishna, the supreme Lord in his grace, out of pure love for us his devotees allows us to approach easily to establish a loving relationship with him. ISKCON and Srila Prabhupad have done a great favour to humanity by establishing the Hare Krishna temples so that we may have an easy access to Lord Krishna. The temple in Bangalore is an amazing piece of architecture no doubt, but my attachment to the place rests in the fact that it is one of the great places where you can go and chant Mahamatra, sing Kirtans and have the lord's Darshan to your hearts content. I love every second I spend there.",1
One of the most visited place in Bangalore. Best time to visit the place would be early morning when there is less traffic and has a peaceful surrounding.,1
Amongst one of the must go places to Bangalore. Dont miss it. It is well connected with metro as well.,1
Very grand and clean. Nicely maintained. The decoration is great and so is the whole setup within the temple. Food court is amazing. Lots of tasty items from many cuisines. Annadanam coupons are given after the food court. It would be better to give it before the food court.,1
"One of the modern-day temples which Bangalore can boast of. It is clean, well-organised and for those who pray Lord Krishna, it is a must visit.",1
"If you are a tourist here in Bangalore and want to visit a temple, this would be a good option. The prasad here is also good.",1
Feels so relaxing and inner peace filled body. Awesome bhajan and kirtans would take anyone to the divine. The followers dance is just too awesome. Felt very close to the divine.,1
21st century temple. The marketplaces that used to be outside are now inside. The main atrium and small temples on way to it are nice. Try the little snacks.,0
"Temple with Good paintings & architecture.
Nice prasadam is served is you are life member

The premises has sweet shop and a veg restaurant",1
Must visit place. Ambiance is very good. you will come out as a devotee of lord krishna. It will take more than an hour to see.,1
"If you are in some tension or want some relief you can visit this place ,sit their have calm your self,the environment is so pleasing",0
"the extreme environment of peace, and the most attracting and good thing are those steps in which 108 times we have to say hare ram mantra it brings up all energy on you",1
Had great opportunity to visit the temple . But it was embarrassing to see lots of gimks and marketing inside temple . Its was more of shopping center than peaceful temple . Disappointment !!!!!,1
"If you don't have a lot of time, let the concierge know and you can get in the quick line. Unless you are planning to worship, this is ideal.",1
Well located. Love to go when ever i am at bangalore it is a place where you meet peoplecfrom north also and very beautiful desiged and arc...love this place,1
"Nice place to have peaceful time with everyone.

Have a peace and fun",1
"It is a well constructed temple in Rajajinagar. If you are a tourist here in Bangalore and want to visit a temple, this would be a good option. The prasad here is also good.",1
The temple is well maintained and has well decorated and bright sanctum. Visitors are made to walk around the stalls which sell ISKON merchandise which makes it more like a walk in a shopping mall than a place of worship.,1
"We generally like the architecture and the beauty of structure of ISKCON temples across India . We make it a point to visit the temple if present in he city we travel. This was the second visit to ISKCON Bangalore . This is one of the major and big ones in the city itself near Mysore sandal soap company . Near to metro and nearly Orion mall. The temple is well maintained and has Tirupathi Balaji and prahaladha Narasimha deities apart from the main deity of Krishna . They have good parking facility . The main temple is wonderfully architected.

As always as any other ISKCON, it has a lot of stalls for sales of books and other stuff . There was a book stall near the darshan place , which could have been avoided for free movement of pilgrims after darshan . Also the free Prasadam place is little crampy , as the queue gets formed on the stairs .

Free lunch tokens are provided when you go in the afternoon time . From 11 : 30 to 2:30",1
"The best time to visit ISKCON is during Diwali and Janamashtami, when the entire building is decked up in lights and the festive vibe surrounds the place.",1
"Marvelous architecture, well organized and structured spot administrated by ISKON Group. Feel the difference when visiting the temple. no more words to say.",1
"It's a temple - so no thing specific to expect other than being a place where you go to get inner peace.

It's well maintained and has specific visiting hours. Only thing which can become little challenging is you have to complete the whole circle round if you want to go inside.

Get the laddoo prasad - it's good.",1
Nice and peaceful place to visit near yeashwanthpur. You can get lunch also there for free. Must visit once.,0
bangalor have only one big temple. this temple are very beautyful.many more light and prasad are awasome image,1
"Visited on the eve of Janmashtami, was crowded but still made all the Darshan on time. Must visit place if you want to be blessed by Lord Krishna :)",1
We have been there with allour family members. This temple runs by ISKCON group and they have their own restrictions for the pilgrims. Jeans / short tops / knitted dresses / Leggings. strictly not allowed for female pilgrims. Be sure that you are wearing Churidars/ Sarees.. For male Shorts / Jeans not allowed. Inside the temple its more commercialised now a days. Whatvever you want to buy it will have thier own rate card. Ensure you have enough cash in hand. Overall the temple view and God is great looking. Have a great Darshan.,1
"Beautiful temple
Incredible ambiance.. Spirituality at its best.. One of the best iskcon temples I have ever seen..",0
Really beautiful place to visit at Iskcon Temple.. Its located on top Hare Krishna Hill's.. Probably I have to bring my parents at ISKCON TEMPLE BANGALORE,1
Nice place to Hangout for young people .Although there should be domination by spiritual mind like their ISCKON Mayapur but you will expect more a hangout place for bangalore tech savvy families . You can say it A spiritual mall .,1
Nice temple to visit in Bangalore ! Very organised and controlled queue management makes visit a pleasure. Nearby metro station is an added advantage for stress free transport !! :-),1
I had been to this temple many times and I liked this temple.Now they made this little commercial friendly which is little odd compared to other temples.,1
"It was a very big campus the idol of the god was very big. there was one very big temple and the others were small ones. There were ample food options. The decoration of the main temple is eye catching, after visiting the temple you will get some peace.",1
"A very beautiful Temple of Lord Krishna, Balarama & Radha
Everyone should Visit and Experience the Feeling and Positive energy",1
"ISCON Temple is one of the choicest landmarks of Bangalore today. Situated at Mahalakshmi Layout Bangalore, it attracts thousands of tourists daily",1
"This temple, when built was one of the trendsetters of modern bangalore. Situated on a hill and very well maintained, it is a must visit place in bangalore.",1
"The lord pooja in the water body is worth watching.. Good for one time visit to see the way it is maintained.. now with metro connectivity and Orion mall next door it is good to visit.. Also, it has in house Swastic veg restaurant which is good",1
"Very commercialized temple. Huge crowd on any occasion but still the management is good. They have steps to reach the main temple which is in a count of 108. Every step you are supposed to repeat: ""hare Krishna hare Krishna, Krishna-Krishna hare hare, hare rama-hare rama, rama-rama hare hare!"" Gives a feel of modern temples.",1
"Its a nicely architectured temple both from outside and inside. Normally there is no/little queue to visit the idols inside the temple except for special occasions like janmastami etc. After visiting Idols, one can see a little museum inside which is worth seeing, Buy laddus and other sweets, but accessories like clothes, sandalwood, idols, calendars and many other stuffs (a little commercial shop). There is also a small food court inside which is not that costly serving bajjis, samosas, sweets and many more stuffs. At last Prasadam (khichdi) will be given to every visitor.",1
Well kept temple ....clean surroundings..but they make us to visit all unwanted shops selling books mementoes and a large food section..I feel they can have a direct exit to people who do not want all this... flower and offerings are not offered to the deity .it's best not to carry them...it's just a waste of money.....there is a veg restaurant in the premises and I felt only the name is higher taste ......the prasada is really tasty and always distributed piping hot...and it's free of cost.....overall experience is good and one can visit once...one of the good places in bengaluru,0
A wonderful temple where people move around in discipline. The monks are very polite.There is ample space. It is in the heart still away from the crowd. This temple is included in Bengaluru Darshan.,0
Wonderful place to visit and spend time in the den of supreme lord Krishna. Elaborate structure. Good queue system. Run professionally. Easy to navigate. Great food options.,1
"We used to visit monthly twice , and I swear this is the best place if you want to get peace from city life.",1
"It was very nice and good experience. But the funny part is, it looks like the shopping mall, not a temple.",1
Elaborate structure. Good queue system. Run professionally. Easy to navigate. Great food options. Organic food store. Occasional interesting events.,1
"Its one of the peaceful and calm temple i ever visited, reaching iskcon is quite easier from any part of Bangalore, and the temple is also very beautiful ,
they are also have lot of things for shopping
lunch is also provided in temple for free",1
"Extra Ordinary place and wonderful place to visit, construction and idols were awesome and must watch visit for everyone who loves heavenly places",0
"Very Spacious, very well maintained temple. Here one will get opportunity to see Lord Narasimha Dev, Lord Balaji and in main temple Lord RadhaKrishna Chandra. Built in modern architecture style attracts people from all around the country. I had been many times. Must visit if you are in Bangalore and have Lord's darshan.",1
Iscon...what ever the temperature outside the temple...inside it is all cool and devoteeship. Hare krishna Hare rama,1
"The place is grossly over hyped - from both tourist and spirituality point of view. If you have limited time in Bangalore than better not to prioritize it.

As it is, Bangalore traffic takes up a lot of travel time and then the temple security and formality have to be complied with. Even when not crowded, the compulsion to repeat the mantra at every step before entering the darshan hall creates slow moving queues without adding any spiritual value. (Can any enforced experience ever be spiritual ? )

After all this ,the architecture and art aren't extraordinary. The main darshan hall does have lovely golden decor and beautifully painted ceiling but then so do most big temples, along with better gardens, carving, history and less hassle.

The exit is a long ,winding route through a "" big bazaar"" of religious items , books and a huge ( and yummy ) variety of food counters. There are even posters offering combo offers and discounts on various pujas !

Nope. Not my cup of tea. For peace of mind , the peaceful Isckon temple in my own city is better, thank you. For tourism , there are other , better places in Bangalore.",1
"Awesome aura around this temple, we visited this place on January 1, 2016 and what a start to the year felt really great.",1
"It looks full devotional while going, but looks full commercial while coming back. There is food court inside the temple",1
"Good Place and nice views , it will be good if you are in early morning itself. Feel relaxed after claming each steps. Food is good.

There is market place to sell their products inside.",1
I probably saw more product display and exhibition than what its supposed to be. Well kept clean complex with good food options,1
"We visited on June 5. There is car parking available within the premises for Rs.30/-. You can opt for the special darshan (for a fee) or the free darshan. The place is a small hillock and after praying at the shrines of Narasimha and Balaji, you can climb on to the main shrine. We were fortunate to take part in the arathi at around 6:30 PM. After the darshan, the exit path leads you to shops at various levels in the complex, selling eatables and CDs, books, gifts. They also serve prasad (a bowl of tamaring/ lemon/ dal rice etc.) at the exit point. On the whole a good temple which is clean. Main drawback: crossing the busy Chord road to go to the other side. Not sure why the temple management and BBMP/ BTP can work together to ensure that there is a good pedestrian crossing or underpass to ensure that people can safely cross the road. You are literally at the mercy of fast traffic when you cross.",1
"If you believe in lord Krishna then a must visit the place, the chanting and festive seasons are really mesmerising. You'll escape to some other place. I just don't like the commercialization part of the temple. But I avoid that and enjoy the rest.",1
Good silent place. You can relax and spend time with family peacefully. Suggest you to visit morning time.,1
"Very special to see. Get blessed by a priest and take the full experience entry, it's worth it. Cost you 1000 rp but you get short lanes and special treats.",1
Good silent place. can relax our mind can spend time with family peacefully. The pooja they make is different from those of other temples. They also have shopping but a bit costly.,1
"The ISKCON temple is a must visit. It is visited by the locals and travelers and hence very crowded. You need to have atleast 2-3 hours for a good darshan and seeing the place minutely.There are quite a number of steps, however they are manageable for normal travelers. Private Cards can go upto a specific point. Better to avoid camera's as you have to keep them with authorities at a specific starting point. There is one toilet at the strting point and then directly at the exit point. Chappals also need to be stored with them, however it is done very systematically without any kind of problems. It is a great architectural work and you can also read the history while in the queue. The main idols are in the huge main hall called ""Hari Naam Kirtan"". As with each Iskcon temple, the idols are just beyond words. After the darshan, you can have many places to shop for souveniors, frames, bags, clothes, books, etc. Best time is to visit between 6 and 8.",1
iskcon temple was one of the famous lord krishna temple in bangalore.i have gone to the iskcon temple and the temple was very nice .,1
"A friend from Bangalore brought us to the Temple. This was an experience I will never forget, the whole visit is great and the inside is so peaceful and beautiful. Go there is visiting Bangaluru",1
"Very nice place, Every weekend I prefer to go Temple. Early morning aarti is like heaven come in earth. If you have plan to come Bangalore please visit once. It's awesome experience.",0
"this place is soo good...
very calm place .....
and these peoples are maintaining the environment so neatly...
and the parking facility is too good",1
"Love the atmosphere here, very healthy to climb till top :) the ambience near the fountain is great, good parking facility too",0
The temple is built over a hillock. The temple is well organized and clean.Food is sold for a price (other than free prasadam that is given after Darshan) and the food is tasty. However the divinity that one sees in other temples is missing and the environment is more commercial.,1
"Well organized, neat, clean and well maintained. Suggest you visit in evening to enjoy the lighting and view. There is a restaurant in temple complex that serves Jain food.

Decently priced with quality food.",1
"The chiming of bells can be heard from half a kilometre away inspite of the madenning cacophany of the infamous Bangalore traffic.

You but cannot help to dwell into where your life is heading to in the rat race? This is a motivation enough for you to climb the staircase of the temple and what follows is but a fantastic date with God.

The climb up to the temple sanctum sanctorum is a circuitous route and designed to heighten your sense of awareness and belonging with 'Him'.

Though the place is fully commercialised yet you cannot miss his presence. Omnipresent. You can hear the chanting Hare Rama Hare Krishna all the way up and beyond.

I strongly advise to sit with your eyes closed and feel him as you reach the sanctum. There will be pushing and hustling but the inner peace you experience post that is unimaginable.

For the connoisseurs of satvic food there is a satvic hotel that will add to the mystism of your visit.

All in all iskcon is one place in Bangalore that can pull you back to human roots. Happy Worshipping!

I",1
"The temple is clean and well maintained, especially by Bangalore City standards. Photography is prohibited but you can quickly sneak a shot or two with your mobile, just for memories not for espionage...hah hah. I found the temple to be too commercialized but i assume that it for the purpose of upkeep. I recommend this as a must see site for the tourist, but don't expect anything as extravagant as the Taj Mahal ;)",1
It's about to 9 km from the hotel and very near to world trade center & Yeswanthpur railway station.,1
"Although I am not the religious type, this is one place in Bangalore I have visited multiple times with my friends or family. Simply because they are very happy visiting this place and I am also not averse to it. Splendid architecture, well organized. Extremely neat and clean. Good options without onion and garlic at great and innovative. Enough parking space. Kids will also enjoy. Only callout is that it is somewhat commercialized, selling a lot of things to devotees.",1
The temple is maintained neat and clean. There are a lot of sign boards and people to guide you - making it very user friendly. The only inconvenience is the way you are approached for buying memberships/ poojas.... money minded is what comes to mind.,1
Divine and peaceful experience. The aarti is a must experience. The devotees chanting and the darshan is a truly divine feeling.,1
"Located on a small hillock, ISKCON is a beautiful temple complex dedicated to Lord Krishna. It is located very near Orion mall which is one of the best shopping malls in Bengaluru. May be crowded on weekends.",1
"Hare Krishna Hill is the Hill on which this temple is situated.,There is a gold-plated dhwaja-stambha and a gold plated kalash shikara . There is free distribution of Sri Krishna prasadam to all visitors during the darshana hours.",1
"The temple is very clean and well built and the entrance is also very well planned and managed. While coming out of the temple, one has to cross 3-4 floors which gives you a feeling of a shopping mall. But one can buy some good stuff there. Do not forget to try various food items at the temple.",1
"This is no different than any other ISKCON temple. Its much larger spread over a much bigger space!
a very peaceful place!
best part is that it isn't dirty. its spotless clean and very very peaceful! worth a visit!",1
There are three temples. After the Darshan you have to go through the forcible shopping walk. Selling Cakes as Prasad. But Temple is very Good.,1
"One of the best Iskon temples across India. Divine darshan of lord Krishna fills your soul with purity.
Prasadam distributed within the temple and other choice of Indian savouries, sweets available on paid basis are finger licking good.",1
"ISKCON has established number of Krishna temples across the world. In Bengaluru, the Hilly Rock of one time converted in to a glorious temple of Lord Krishna. The environment at the temple premises is very calm and one would get peace of mind once he enter the premises of the temple. All the days you will find rituals and one can get Prasadam at the temple. For meditation it is a wonderful place. One can visit the temple with family and children. ISKCON TEMPLE AT BENGALURU is a must visit place, when you are on a tour to Bengaluru. B M ANAND",1
"Traditional place to visit in Bangalore. It has a 108 steps to say ""Hare rama Hare Krishna"" mantra 108 times. I found this as unique way of counting..",1
This place is so clean and organised. As soon as you enter a blanket of peace takes over. The evening aarti is mesmerizing i just went in trance. You dont feel like leaving the place. I heard the prasadam is great too though i could not have it myself. Beautiful experience.,1
"Great place, always liked it but of late, there is huge crowd when you are coming out from the temple and temple authorities need to manage it in a better way.",0
This devine location is very clevely constucted. The bhajans and the preachings in the temple will sure make your mind peaceful.,1
"Solace for the soul. An awesome aerial view of the surrounding city. The ""prasadam"" is hot and tasty. Good vegetarian stuff is available for the hungry.",1
"It's a glorified mall for religious purpose. You have all type of gods to serve your requirement. Many options available as per your budget to please the god.

Can be visited as a tourist place, the way we visit any other shopping complex/mall.",1
"Very beautifully built temple. The place is very near to orion mall, hence one can park his car there and then go walking to this place. Siting in the main hall on top is a good place for meditation. weekends may be crowded, hence better to visit on weekdays. The variety of snacks offered at a cost as Prasads are also very good. The house of the Supreme Lord is always open to all to seek his blessings.",1
Very good to go in the mornings - spiritual and quiet but too much traffic to get here. As per driver - it should have taken 25 minutes but we cam here after 2 hours - Bengaluru traffic is very high inside city area..,1
"This is a place to visit but keep in mind the mandate nature of the temple keepers.
They want you to follow everything they do on a dominant basis as if they are the nazis you need to follow.
I like the place, it has peace and solitude but when in connect with the fellow men of the temple they would try to force you into doing things like taking gods name and all nasty godly things that should come from within..
I just want to say one thing God is all places and I do respect and follow the almighty but a human cannot force you to do things unwillingly that you need to do even if u r in a bad health zone..
Keeping the humans aside the place is good with nice amount of architecture and splendid domes, chandelier..",1

Very elaborate and gives complete feeling f devotion. The deities are very atractive and give you feeling of being near to almighty.,1
"A very good practice followed here is the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha mantra
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna,
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare,
Hare Rama Hare Rama,
Rama Rama Hare Hare
They make you chant this 108 times while you are going in line to see the Narasimha swamy in the temple at the beginning, there are 108 pedestals raised around the Narasimha swamy Garba gudi and for each chant, you need to increase your pedestal count, thereby making you keep track of your chant 108 times.
Hare Krishna!!",1
"One of the large ISKCON temples around and one of the busy temple too. Modern Traditional temple, clean and built with amenities which lags in most of the temples. No wonder more popular among the foreigners. Large place and be prepared to walk up and down the stairs in a line. Choose non holiday day to visit where you can enjoy the temple better. Nice value added souvenir shops and excellent food items sold. It can be easily a family event for 2 to 3 hours well spent!",1
"One of the best temple in Bangalore, beautiful architecture and peaceful. Visit this place in evening. It is beautiful with evening lights. Radha Krishna gods are the main attraction of the temple. Very clean and peaceful temple.",1
"The temple of Radha Krishna is worth seeing. The precious stone studded idols are amazing. The gold plated sides of the main altar with its intricate carvings is eye catching. The very high ceilings with paintings conveying the story of Lord Krishna is superb. One can buy the Bhagawad Gita by Swami Prabhupada translated into various regional languages.

There is very tight security. The place is very cleanly maintained. Cameras are not allowed - but there are cloak rooms to leave your camera and collect them on the way out.

A large number of steps need to be taken to reach the sanctum sanctorum - elderly people could find it difficult - but I think there are special darshan passes to avoid the steps (not sure - saw some signages about special darshan at extra cost).

The bhajans are very soothing and captivates everyone who is around.",1
The ISKON temple is very beautiful especially because its fully white inside...the walls and the floor...its pretty far from the city so was quite a ride to reach here...but it was worth it...,1
This place is good for religious people and people who love traditional architecture and paintings and designs. Its a must destination in one day bangalore tour,1
"Most ISKCON temples around the world are aesthetically designed & they have excellent architecture. I recommend that one sit in meditation in the prayer hall. It leaves a good feeling.
One can also contribute to ""Akshya Pathra"" the initiative that the temple has taken to feed 1.5 lakh poor kids.",0
"This is not the traditional temple that once usually visits. It has been built keeping in mind the modern visitors. The area across which is spans is huge. Once you climb the stairs of teh temple, you can see the Bangalore city - as its located on a hilltop.

The animated movie sections is greatly recommended for kids. Besides, once can actually visit the handicraft section for purchase of worship related metal containers and mythology related paintings.The normal food & general itemsale counters wil also take much of your time.

Overall, i say this place requires time, as it can comfortably take half of your day.",0
One of the most beautiful ISKCON Temple. I visited early morning on Sunday and had great experience. Claim and peacefull dharanam.,0
"Its not a traditional ancient hindu temple, its a modern temple. We joined the prayer dance in the main hall, it was a new experience for us.",1
"ideal visit time would be during the maha Aarthi time in the eveinings; with the temples lights and the serene and blissfull mood is set...

well synchronized and I could say choreographed Arthi along with the chants and dances...provides true spiritual culmination to a great evening...",1
"Must visit place in bangalore!!! I often visit this place with my friends. One had to struggle a bit in queue with sun making it miserably tough but once you are inside, you feel amazed the quietness of this place in the middle of city. This place is also next to metro station and many malls. So if you want to tour bangalore, this place is best as you can reach this spot easily and can visit malls as a bonus!!!",1
"The Iskcon temple in Bangalore is beautiful! From the moment you step in, you can feel the divinity of the place. It has been commercialized with tickets for darshan which allow you to skip the line and I personally feel buying them is worth it! The murals on the ceiling are stunning and its difficult to get your eyes off the deity.
If you're a believer, go for the experience, and if not, go for the art :)",1
"Temple is constructed on top of a hill. Its view from bottom is amazing... The floral decoration that they do for Idols is just mind blowing. You cant even find a misalignment. We have Lord Venkateswara Idol also in the same temple, which is another big blessing for everyone... The architecture and paintings inside the temple will make you WOW... After Darshan, You will be directed to their private shopping area where you will find good traditional Indian sweets and ethnic wear... You can spend 2-3 hours spiritually and happily. Orion mall is just behind this temple, You can visit that too...",1
"I visited with family, this temple is quite silent and you will feel very different inside.
I had this wonderful experience which I want to share.",1
"Very neat and well maintained temple situated on Hare Krishna Hill. It provides a wholesome experience of faith & spirituality. Visit with family, do Pooja, sit in quiet atmosphere, de stress yourself in the serence and blessed surrounding of Lord Krishna's temple !

There is free distribution of Prasadam to all visitors during the darshana hours

You visit this place several times and yet you feel a new way everytime you come back !",1
"Keep a few hours handy before entering. You never know how much time, it will take for the darshan. The temple is well connected. There is some space for parking but it gets filled easily on weekends and evenings. So, be prepared for that.",1
very good place to see in bangalore. Temple architecture very different . Lord Venkateswara swamy and Lord Narasimha swamy temples are good to see.,1
Visited this temple with some colleagues from abroad. It was the right place to give a taste of Indian Temples and Indian Culture. The Temple being a privately managed is well maintained and disciplined.,1
"A wonderful location combining devotion, food, luxury, shopping etc., This is a spot you will not hesitate to visit often too. Please do not forget to visit the theatre shows that run short films. Architecture of the temple is amazing and the best among all the ISKCON temples I think. This is one of the top most locations in Bangalore, one should not miss.",1
"right from entrance, you begin chanting the mantra with each step you take (if you are in a queue). Weekdays are easier as there is not much crowd. The temple is so clean and well kept. the food is very tasty and the shopping for satvik items is excellant.",1
one of the tourist attraction in Bangalore.beautiful temple where a true devote would enjoy the calmness,1
"So I visited this temple wid my grandmother.she was surprised looking at this temple.looking at it from outside ,she thought it looks like an office with all the glasses .once we entered the temple ,we observed a few people fully busy in meditation.but it wad when we were coming out of this temple we saw there were many shops in temple premises.they were selling cd's and clothes and a lot of other things.honestly it doesn't gives a feeling of genuine indian temple.it seems like a business venture created to entertain and confuse the foreigners .",1
"the beauty of the sparkling gold inside the temple is amazing.
the whole temple lights up due the gold idols.
the management system is also great.
and the path is also not tiring.
the best part is the beauty of the temple",1
"The must visit place in Bangalore presents most beautiful god idols of lord Krishna, lord Venkateshwara etc.
The place is too calm,clean. Food and shopping facilities are also there.",1
"One of the beautiful temple in bangalore city, must visit if you are in bangalore, in bangalore there are many places but the iscon temple is beautiful place to see in bangalore.",1
just be there to be with the lord. very nice temple on a hill. rare feat in a city. lord venkateshwara also adorns this temple-looks like balaji from tirupati specially when aarati is performed with lights off,1
"Every one must go and pray, you will feel the power of almighty God. Advice to take special entry ticket to avoid the long Q.",0
Visit only if you are really religious. The paintings on the inside of the ceiling are the only good part in the temple.,1
"Though I have visited here multiple times, but got to know from their website and few of my friends that early morning puja called Mangala aarati is awesome. So planned one.

Reached temple at 4:00 O'clock in morning.. There was no special dharsan or ticket. Entered into main temple very quickly and the sequence of puja started that enclosed multiple aarti and puja. The entire puja was almost an hour.

It was one of the best morning I had in my life. I was feeling awesome and charged. I would suggest everyone once in a lifetime should take that experience.",1
"The Temple was very good, neatly maintained and is very disciplined. The Location was easily accessible and is very near to Yeswanthapur Railway Station and Satellite Bus Station. I went there with my Fiance and had a very good and peaceful time until i finished my darshan. Then the Business starts , you are forced to a series of shops and stalls for a very long duration that by the time you reach the end you would have forgot that you were here for Lord Krishna. All the items were highly priced that most of them can be bought at 1/4 just outside the temple premises.Except of this the temple can be visited once in a while.

The ISCKON should start treating temples as is and should start building shopping complexes if they are very much interested in Business.",1
"This is a must watch for all...
One of the best temples I have ever seen so clean so well maintained... Food too is awesome...",1
"The temple is famous for its grandeur, sculpture, exceptional and consistent tradituonal devotional service to the Lord amidst modern equipments and gadgets. Nice prasadams too of many varieties and devotional shopping.
Must visit in Bangalore.",1
Very nice temple built up a hill. Peaceful location were foreigners can really blend in and feel the local culture.,1
"Iskcon is a famous temple in India.In India,bangalore iskcon is famous.I enjoyed a lot in this temple.The construction of this temple is super.",1
"ISKON is a combination of devotion, outing and dining probable fine dining too.. The temple is awesome.. Higher Taste is a restaurant, vegetarians love the taste of that food.The outer perimeter is a pleasant time pass for 2 to 3 hours...",1
Do purchase the pass before entering. it helps in skipping the queues and also a close view of Lord Krishna. View from the top is quite good and parking arrangements are done efficiently.,1
"We visit Iskon Radhe krishna temple very often.its must see place for bangalore visitors.its on the hill,devotees will be offering pooja and bhajans,its breath taking during aarathi time.get all sorts of pooja accessaries and nice snacks,prasadam.",1
A completely hygienic place with lots of positive energy. A great place to spend time with yourself. The less said better. Trust me it is worth the experience.,1
"i liked the temple the maintained but fairly felt as shopping complex.

good stuff to buy and great place to meditate.",1
Whether you are a krishna devotee or not does not matter.. If you happen to be in bangalore this is a 'must see' place.,0
"For those interested in Hinduism or Indian culture in general, this is a great place to go when in Bangalore. The place is a modern, 30-year old complex of different temples. The temple interior is not really spectacular, but the atmosphere and the enthusiasm of the people is quite appealing. Its usually quite crowded there.",1
"Get ready to walk up the many steps to see 3 shrines . There are lifts for life members, elderly and pass-holders. Prahlada Narasimha is the first shrine. Srinivasa Govinda is the second. The third is a set of shrines in a huge hall comprising of the idols of Krisna and Balarama, Radha and Krishna and Nitai Gauranga. Remember to look up and observe the lovely paintings on the ceiling. Thereafter you will have to walk through a multitude of shops that sell pictures, books, eateries, apparel -all related to Isckon and the idols therein. You will queue up for relieving Prasadam and then exit. There are shows about Krishna in a small theatre, for a fee. There is a Sattvic restaurant ""High Range"" in the temple compound, which offers delectable vegetarian food.",1
"ISCON, in many ways is different from a typical south indian temple..The vibe is more cultural than religious.Temple itself is very beautiful and crowd management is good. Ambience is calm and positive , but weekends are crowded.
There is an option of a alternate entry patch with a nominal fee of Re.600 for 6 people which includes a prasadam packet and a book. The option is very good for people who are on a quick visit and are short of time. Once the darshan is over there a well stocked food court and stalls to buy temple memorabilia.

To me,it was a experience which I believe should be how religion needs be interpreted in the coming ages , not preachy or deterring, but imbibing the values and morals into our life and culture.",0
"I had visited The ISKCON temple with family and friends during my visit to Bangalore. It was a divine experience. There are two queues, one general and one special which you can avail with a slightly higher cost. You should visit the temple once whenever you in the city.",0
Very peaceful place. We went on a weekday so the place was not so crowded. There is a small shopping market at the end of temple. You can buy souvenir from there.,1
"Very beautiful temple. You can feel the ambience, calmness and some kind of energy in this temple. I strongly recommend visiting this temple in Bengaluru.",1
Nice temple to spend some peaceful time. Don't go during weekend and public holidays as this place will be very crowded.,1
Very good temple in Heart of Bengaluru. Must visit temple in Bangalore. I visited number of times and all the time I am getting new feeling. It is simply awesome.,0
Needless to say as all Iskcon temples in the country is serene and peaceful and this one is no exception. Good place to be in if your mind is troubled.,1
It was a good experience at this place. One can take a metro too to this place as the metro station is at the walking distance. The thing this has commercialised a lot and you can see a large space to buy and eat endless products. But worth a place to visit once.,1
"hare krishna
for all krishna devotees and tourists absolute tranquility
a place of worship worth entering and praying",1
"There would be about 200 stairs to climb I think. The architecture and the statues are very good.

The only reason I gave 4 is the place is too commercialized (just like all iskons), everyone is just trying to sell you something be it spiritual stuff or food.",0
It's a beautiful temple and spread out over a large area. It's very clean and organised. The temple precincts reverberate with a sound of peace. It's a great spiritual experience!,1
This is one of the busiest place for religious activities that have witnessed in recent time.any religious person would love to pay visit to,1
"I was lucky enough to be working in Bangalore when they had a holy day and I seized the opportunity to do a temple Tour (and boy there are a LOT of temples in Bangalore ).

The ISKCON however, is at the top of its class. Huge and imposing from its hilltop position, I was awestruck as we strolled, chanted, bowed, prayed and danced our way around.

Free food is given at one point (not for the weak of stomach), and there are endless chances to take photos.

Really worth a visit, even an atheist like me came away feeling uplifted.

Recommended",1
"Mesmerizing experience, So much peace at the temple , you can also buy many souvenirs like books music CD and some other uncommon stuff at reasonable prices.",1
"This place is calm and composed that one will like almost everything in here. Great structure of the building and definitely a place for Lord Krishna worshippers.They serve lunch also, pure veg delicious food here. but you will have to walk through a long queue which will take you to different halls where they sell different stuff and you cannot take any detour.",1
"to get get stress free from work, this place is real good. viisted here many times , as when get breather from schedule",1
Needless to say as all Iskcon temples in the country is serene and peaceful and this one is no exception. Good place to be in if your mind is troubled.,1
It was a good experience at this place. One can take a metro too to this place as the metro station is at the walking distance. The thing this has commercialised a lot and you can see a large space to buy and eat endless products. But worth a place to visit once.,1
"hare krishna
for all krishna devotees and tourists absolute tranquility
a place of worship worth entering and praying",1

This place of worship is worth visiting if you are in Bengaluru. Very well maintained and disciplined crowd.,1
What a amazing feeling when we reached there you can not go running or hurry you have to go step by step you can not cross or over take any one. Really peaceful on top. We want to visit once again.,1

Temple have good crowd management facilities, at peak you may need to be in queue for a long time to get into central temple. Inside temple artwork is splendid and Radha Krisha idol is divine. You will enjoy the hare rama hare krishna chants throughout your temple visit. Once you are out of the central temple, commercialization starts. They have put stalls of almost everything, prices are high too, They have kept the same item again and again to make sure you dont miss it. You can enjoy free prasadam or can get good food at their restaurant.",0

Don't forget to where trousers and long sleeves. If you forget you can always rent one arriving in the temple.
INR 500 as a deposit (returned at the end of your visit) and INR 20 for laundry.

Must see temple for someone visiting Bangaluru. Beauty and cleanliness are part of ISKCON. Very well maintained premises. You need to climb few stairs. Very beautifully constructed and maintained. The architecture is splendid. Inside the premises you have so many options to have food at very reasonable prices.,1

"It's wonderful place to expand time with friends and family. It's very spiritual place.
And inside their so much food option is also their.",1
"High tech temple !!! is what many of us in Bengaluru refer to ISKCON. It is no where close to traditional south indian temple in look although it does carry its own aura due to its location at higher altitude and concrete jungle surrounding it (Orion mall, Huge residential township coming next to it and Bangalore metro that tuns opposite to temple). Overall its a must see for someone visiting Bengaluru. Also nearby to Iskcon is famous Orion mall and also Prasaana Veeranjeneya Temple (huge monolith carving of Lord Hanuman) which are at walkable distance from the temple.",0
"A very nice temple to visit in Bangalore , Dont miss it when ever you visit bangalore.

Atleast you can spend half day here , it will be crowded during weekends.

Better Plan for weekdays.",1
Absolutely loved the place. Has got beautiful carvings and has a mix of Indian and wester influence in the construction,1
lovely place n nice food. one holy place you want to stay to stay blessed. kudos to the creator. carry on the spiritualism.,1
"Creating a lovely atmosphere of Shanthi ...
really awesome temple to visit and get piece of mind.....",0
A very nice place to hang out with family member.. The temple is very well maintained and clean.. Also there are lots of snacks available inside the temple premises.. The hot kichdi / prasadam served is superb..,1
"I really wanted to visit this temple from the pictures I saw online. This is a super busy temple, and the organisation has everyone queuing like herded cows with metal barriers in between. The temple itself has a gorgeous roof and reveals great views across Bangalore. The only thing that really upset me was the ""duty free"" two floors of shops and stalls you have to walk through to get to the exit. It somehow feels very inappropriate in a religious building.",1
"Beautiful campus, pretty idols and decoration, tasty food.

But its not as calm as other ISKCON and felt to be too commercial.",1
Very nice place to visit. What I liked the most is the Hare Rama Hare Krishna chant by stepping through the blocks. It gave me lot of focus and was equivalent to a meditation. One of the best ways to enforce focus which very few temples have. This is much better than Mumbai Iskcon,1
"Very nice attraction in Bengaluru. Family , Friends all can visit but keep in mind the dress code for ladies here. Short dresses\3/4ths or sleeveless tshirts or salwar kameez are not alllowed here.

The morning program starts at 4:15 am and ends at 9:00 am. Darshan is open till 1:00 PM.

It is located in Rajajinagar, Bengaluru and is definately a must visit attraction if you are planning on a day trip within bengaluru itself.

It is one of the largest Iskcon temples in the world.

There is art and handicraft sold within the temple but It is on the very expensive side so if you are able to purchase it then you are indeed lucky.",1
You can visit this place with your friends family or your love one. It is a very good place to visit and the provid a meal also in afternoon. You will enjoy it.,1
"Let's start with useful advice for visitors from overseas I was directed to a separate entrance and then following the barriers ended up ahead of the devotees which felt a bit awkward. However the 300 rupee entrance seemed to be paying for this and also a bag of Indian sweets/ biscuits and a free devotional book !I was prayed over and made to feel welcome despite being a woman visiting on her own. There are notices saying no photography or cameras and in fact my camera had to be left with security even though I would not have used it. as is normal in Hindu temples no shoes , but it is not clear where to leave them although there is in fact a large cloakroom for them. I f you get lost the ground can be scorching as you find your way - take socks. I accepted the free rice and tried to eat correctly but failed miserably. It felt rude to refuse.
There are lots of things to buy but you do not have todo so and I never felt pressurised. I have seen similar goods in many western cathedrals.
But. The temple itself is spectacular and it is possible to have some time of quiet reflection and I accepted the prayer said over me in the spirit it was intended. This an experience not to be missed.",1
"the best part is their crowd control strategy by asking people to follow the steps one by one during entry ,they have a movie hall to show films and a good food court",1
"The temple is beautiful and well maintained. Very Crowded on weekends, but there was no pushing/jostling, so you just move along the queue without any hassles. Inside we bought a puja ticket which allowed us to view the deity from close and in a peaceful manner. After Darshan we sat for some time and waited for the Aarthi. aarthi time is amazing and a must watch",1
I have been visiting this temple for last 20 years .it is very well organized and clean place.The poojas are performed in very religious way and devotees are treated with a lot so coutasy .Good quality food is available to suit all . There is ample place for parking expect on holidays where you may find difficult to find parking,1
It was ok to visit but no way to make a picture in this temple. Why no photography in the temple which I cannot understand. It was more commercial that worship.,1
"Early morning visit to get a glimpse of Arathi of Deities of Lord Venkateshwara ,Sri Narasimha Swamy, Lord krisha in main temple are amazing experiences and blissfull. Very beautiful temple, very friendly and smiling disciples with whom you can join during chanting & dancing Hare Krishna songs. You can get free Prasadams as well.
ISCON also runs free mid day meal program to under privileged school children & you can donate generously to participate in their mission.",1
"The temple premise is beautiful..!! I would love to visit the temple again but on a better day when there is less crowd.

You cannot directly come out of the temple, you have to go through all the shops, food stalls,etc. This was a huge no-no for me, it ended up being more like a picnic place than a place of worship.

Ladies - Sleeveless tee,dresses needs to be covered so kindly prepare yourself beforehand",1
"This temple has great architectural value, built on a hillock, attracts a lot of visitors from within India and foreigners. It's maintained nice and clean. But the only thing I felt is there is something sold at almost every step of the way. Books, CDs even in the main sanctum and as you exit you have to pass through their stalls where they sell almost everything. Minus this I think it is a great place. It is siutated on Chord Road, close to Mahlakshmi Layout Metro station and near Yeshwantpur.",1
"Such peace and tranquility is attained here, difficult to describe. The best time to visit especially in summers is early morning say around 5-5:30 am, one gets a good darshan and also gets time to pray.",1
Infrastructure Is very good... unfair with common people in entry.. maintenance is very good...helping poor children by serving mid day meal program. .,1
Very nice and beautiful temple located on top of hills...though you have to climb the stairs to reach the main temple. There are many other small small temple...the only negative thing was when to want to exit the temple - there is to much of twist and turn as they have lot of sellers for books / toys / eatables.,1
"One would have seen a Hindu temple in Nagara or Dravida style built entirely from stone. ISKCON has used glass in the gopuram which makes it 'modern'.
A very beautiful temple in the northern part of the city. Be sure to visit it when in Bengaluru.",0
Visited temple in second half of the day. When the lights were on the place looks so beautiful. Silent background chants of hare rama hare krisha and soft breeze makes the ambience super awesome. I loved this temple.,1
"Try to visit early morning can have an glimpse of Arathi of Dieties Lord Venkateshwara ,Sri Narasimha swamy, main temple Lord krisha, an amazing and blissfull day to start with, very beautiful and simplistic temple very friendly and smiling deciples,you can join them while chanting & dancing Hare Krishna feels like you are an kid again, Pls feel free to ask for free Prasadam

ISCON also runs free mid day meal program to unprivilaged school children you can donate generously to fulfill your BIG HEARTEDNESS.",1
"The temple complex has a beautiful Guest house, very well furnished, well maintained Rooms with courteous staff equipped with dining facilities catering divine Prasadams . Persons who are life members as well as Dharmadhikari's are provided free accomodation for specific periods. More than all these, the enchanting spiritual environment echoing chanting of ""Hare Krisna...Hare Krishna..."" takes you very close to the divine feet. Early morning Sacred bath to the deities should not be missed. Devotees will not get this experience any where else. We stay every year at the Guest House to enjoy this blissful environment.",1
"Lovely ambience, no seeking alms, clean environment and lovely sanctum sanctorum. A place every one must visit in Bangalore and one visit would make it memorable.",1
Neatly maintained as required. It gives peace of mind when visited.Nice place to visit again and again in Bangalore.,1
Visiting this temple made me relax from all the excursions. Beautiful idols of Shri Radha Krishna were mesmerising.,1
"Well maintained, nice spiritual place. This one hour journey was very nice experience. Items on sale were different and economical. View from Sheraton room attached.",1
Need to wear full pant or dhoti while entering to Iscon temple... Or else you need to pay 500 RS to purchase a new dhoti..Only for gents.,1
went there just to look at it. after reaching there it was really peaceful.Stayed there for few hors just sitting in fornt of the space of krishna statues. it really felt peaceful from inside. a totally man ki shanti.!!,1
"The main sanctum is carved beautifully with dazzling gold and the idols of Radha Krishna is just mesmerizing. The continuous chant of the mantra and despite the presence of thousands of people is quietening. One has to walk a huge number of steps but the management staff is empathetic to let people with problems in knee use the lift.
One can sense over merchandising in some parts. But we liked to movie, the walk, the food etc really well.",0
"My experience of ISKCON was coming from Vrindavan, however this one is very disappointing. The entrance itself will make you stand in a queue for an hour atleast and the darshan lasts only for a few minutes before you start retreating into their well coordinated shopping mall, where one can buy all devotional items. Its ok if one really wants to purchase and look around, but for those who just want a darshan are also forced to exit the same way as the shopping mall. Overall if you a real ISKCON experience try Delhi,Vrindavan or even Kolkata.",1
"This is a very pretty temple. I am a Christian but truly enjoyed the art of the Temple. No one forces any of their rituals on you. The only thing I found bad is you have to go barefoot thru them all. Make sure to bring socks that you can throw away after,",1
temple shopping mall all in one place metro staation mahalakshmi nearby lots of item to purchase books cheaper,1
"A beautifully built temple atop a shall hillock and run by the Hare Rama Hare Krishna trust. The idol is well carved and pretty looking. One can have same snacks or eat something from a host of dishes available there or do some shopping of souvenirs or religious books, CDs etc. The trust also run the free mid day meals for the needy children in various schools run by some NGOs.",1
"Visited this temple when I was in Bangalore. Try to avoid peak days and festivals if you really want to explore this place. Very different from other traditional temples. There are a lot of souvenir shops there but make sure to compare prices before purchasing. Visited the place during November, so it was very cooling.",1
"Had time to kill, so went to the Temple. Resulting in getting late for the next meet. The temple is beautiful. And most peaceful. The aura and the beauty of the idols is simply mesmerising.",1
This a huge ISKCOn temple but alas very crowded. You may enjoy the architecture but may get hassled with crowd. Also it has become very commercialized with shop selling food clothes and other items at exit,1
"Went there on Saturday evening through heavy traffic near temple area. However luckily temple premises was not at all crowded and it was very peaceful inside.

It is well managed place like depositing footwear and cloak room facilities were good. You have to go through from 2 other temples before you reach the main temple. Main temple is very well constructed with gold and must watch.

One can buy various SEVA of different amounts like 300, 1000, 5000 rupees. I did 300 Rs. Pushpanjali Seva in which we were allowed to do darshan from one row closer than regular row. Additionally we got a special Prasadam.

Finally when you exit the main temple then its little unpleasant to go through the heavyily commercialized path where you are forced to go through various kind of shops like book-shops, sweets shops; followed by big cafeteria having food stalls.

Overall place was one time watch and OK kind of place. Don't expect WOW things to happen when you go there.",1
"systematic q to get inside the temple.in.the first tier we can have darsan of sri narasimmar.in the second tier we have darsan of sri balaji.inthe third tier we have darsan of sri krishna and radha, befor krishnan sannadhi ,there is one big dyana mandapam,where all the devotees sit here for some minutes and chants krishna naamam. on return in every tier we have shops,we can purchase pooja things also prasadams.annadanam is also done here.a place worthseeing.",1
ISCKON Temple is a Hindu Temple and the one in Bangalore is one of the biggest and the best in India. It's located in Yeswantpur area right next to the Orion Mall. The architecture is modern day but has been designed keeping ancient vedic values. The main sanatorium is just too beautiful and regular prayers are held all the time. There are stay options available inside the temple premises for devotees. I have seen people from all faith and religion visiting here. So it's a must go if you are in Bangalore. Don't forget to munch on the sweets and the prasad before you leave.,0
"My friend suggest me, you should come ISKON Temple, i went there awesome temple i really feel nice, awesome holistic place. so much follower of Lord Krishana.",1
The Pooja of the main shrine is a beautiful act that should be witnessed by all. A beautiful temple but crowded,1
Beautiful place to visit at evening time . I visited with my spiritual mother and she was amazed by the calmness and beauty of it.,1
"Beautiful temple I seen in Bangalore,while entering there in big gallery for photos & spiritual boos with affordable price Free food is available",1
"The temple is no doubt serene, clean and beautiful.Sadly it seemed commercial, unlike the other temple I have visited here.The security is very strict and importantly you are not allowed in shorts. In that case, you need to hire the traditional dhoti for which they charge ‚Çπ 500-/, which if you don't have at the moment they might ask you to deposit your mobile, as happened with us.",1
"I have been there ISKON temples in pune, delhi already. last year i got chance to visit this temple with my parents. the place was really beautiful and quite. the entry was quite organized. you can easily spend 2-3 hours there by sitting. if someone needs a quite place in bangalore to read his favorite book then this place is best.",1
Beautiful temple to visit. Calm and peaceful..makes you feel connected.Superb maintenance... Looking forward to visiting again.,1
Nic to visit iskon.i am going regularly with my all new friend whoever is coming bangalore first time.take caring people.also feeling relax after visiting there.peacefull place.,1
The place is Divine so is the aura around the whole place. Its easy to reach as metro is connected to this place from MG road. the food is awesome and so is the prasadam. Its breezy in the evenings and U can stay inside if its day time. The hall is huge and beautiful. The place is beautiful and the stone carvings add to its charm and authenticity.,1
Very organised entry to the temple. Although it does not really feel like a temple really. The overall premises is really big but is maintained very nicely,1
I always visit this temple. Good to be there. Peaceful and very calm. Like the architecture and beautiful crafting on temple wall.,1
"This temple is a must visit for all tourist to Bangalore.
It is beautifully situated on a hilltop and each floor has different avathars of krishna.
There is narashima in one floor, lord balaji in another and the last floor has radha krishna. It is really beautiful.",1
"Excellent place to visit! Lots to see, great place to take pictures. Wear appropriate clothing, be prepared to take off shoes",1
"Beautiful hill top, serene and calm place always reverberating with Hare Rama Hare Krishna chants.

As always ISKON maintains its premises very clean and neat. I have been a regular visitor to this temple, starting from early morning, mid day to late evenings. Apart from divinity, the place also offers excellent vegetarian food in its on premises restaurant.",1
"Approx 30 KMs away from main city or MG road but worth visiting.. Really peaceful and beautiful..
Same like other ISKON but more lavish and peaceful.
Must try Food over there which is available inside the premises, u will love it..
Camera not allowed so couldn't capture the beauty..",0

A must visit for those who is searching for inner peace and tranquility. One of the best places for meditation. Though the main temple is going under construction still it is worth visiting for travelers who are visiting Bangalore for the 1st time,1
Must Visit if you are in Bangalore. Visit during evening time (Aarti) you will feel totally different. Beautifully made.,1
"very peaceful place to visit, it is very near to yeswantpur railway station.
easily availability of auto and cab.",1
Take the 1000 rupies ticket (1 ticket for 6 persons) and get extremely close to the ornaments and see how wonderful the priests do their rituals.,1
Perfect Destination for enhancing spiritual quotient in your Bangalore trip. A must place for Food(Strict Veg) and loose yourself to Lord Krishna. Jai Sri Krishna!!!,1
"I am an atheist and I still occasionally visit temples to enjoy some solace, which is difficult here. Too noisy and commercial and hence not a place to find solitude for me.",1
Worth a visit! Absolute must visit if you are in the city for a week or so. It is beautiful and lovely ambience.,1
"ISKCON is an ICON of Bangalore and probably the 1st centre of Lord Krishna built in India. Though it's a temple with mythology lots of good music (bhajans) relieve one from stress and fatigue if one listens to it with attention, we read recently London scientists research proved music cures diseases. Children too can enjoy the story of Krishna represented in simple language pictorially. Being on modest Hill top it's serene view of Bangalore, children enjoy a lot. For elderly its true pilgrimage with beautiful temples with great culture. It has good, hygiene food to buy at the end of visit to satisfy taste buds

Suggest you don't rush the visit if you are first time visitor to enjoy thoroughly, budget 2 to 3 hours",1
It is one of the largest iskcon temples in the world. It is extremely clean and well maintained. The food served is excellent. It is definitely worth a visit to see especially for Lord Krishna devotees,1
Really well maintained. The journey from the entrance to the exit was a smooth one. The evening lights add to the glory. Best time to visit is after 5PM,1
It's one of the biggest ISKON temples in the world. Very nice but too crowded when we visited on a Sunday. Lots of walking and queue everywhere.,1
"In this busy world, sometimes its hard to find peace, when you require the most. However, to find peace you have let go few things and as you enter this temple you will do forget everything because of its beauty and hence you finally find peace in life.",1
"Thousands of people visit this place everyday. It is difficult to differentiate between this and any other commercial establishment. People throng this place like anything. It is a man made structure and there are so many rules and restrictions. Gods over there look very artificial. It is not like any traditional south indian temple.

In any traditional south indian temple you can feel the presence of energy within the temple. I don't feel that when I visit this place. Many people like the chanting done over there ""Hare rama Hare Krishna"". If you are not keen on this chanting, you may find it little uncomfortable. Also at times when you are in the queue there is one temple where people keep going round 108 times chanting ""hare rama hare krishna"". Even if you don't want to chant you may end up being in that circle and you cannot get out of it either. Slowly you will fall in the path. Chanting is good, however if you want silence in the temple you may feel out of place.

One good thing about this place is that it is neatly maintained. There is lot of screening and the security over there are very harsh and rude. Once he started checking my cousin brother's body all over without any reason saying it is their rule. It is little awkward. Once my cousin sister was running into the temple as it was raining. They chased her and said she should be checked. Then we refused to go into the temple and came out. That is the problem with all the commercial establishment. A temple is a place of worship and if they want they can install scanners all over and not do any manual checks. It is really pathetic.

Gods are same as the ISKON gods all over. It is very difficult for South Indians to see god in such a form. Our perception about the way god looks is entirely different. If you are taking elderly people watch out there is huge walking all around especially if you are coming from the bottom. If you are parking upstairs it will reduce the walk a big. Still there is a huge walk path before you get out. There are hundreds of shops lined up to buy anything you want on lord krishna and so many eatables. Can visit if you have ample of time, otherwise can give a skip.",1
"The institution promoted for the cause of bhakti and service stands tall. Iskcon is easily accessibly by rail, metro, buses and taxis.

The architecture is beautiful as we can see the sky through them.

Once inside the temple you would feel the warmth of God, and breeze of his love.

Yes, please chant
Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare

You will be leaving the temple premises with a lot of vigour and stress free.

I suggest all to visit ISKCON Bangalore at least once in a life time",1
"A very good place that is iconic to Bangalore. The discipline, cleanliness and the ambiance is very well maintained here. The Akshaya Patra mid-day meals scheme is also prepared here that has a MEGA kitchen. Do visit there if possible
I feel good to visit temple, Bajans and Arti were good.
And there are many more activities like Yoga, Etc
Easy transportation avilable near by there is good restaurants for lunch and dinner as well as close to Orion mall",1
Was interesting to me to see this; visited around 4.30 on Saturday. There was some service ongoing at the time. Sounds as interesting as the sights. Such a lot of gold!,1
Very good and calm place. Very crowded and small. Difficult to park car outside. But very peaceful. Inside the city.,1
"From the old age prospective there are many stairs. And there is no direct route. You need to go from all the temples then only you would see the main temple.
After Darshan routes are diverted to the shops and there is no direct exit for the old age person. One who do not wants to go to shops has to because no other way to direct exit.",1
Very superb and excellent place to visit. we can feel the peaceful in that temple. Also we can feel the good positive vibration in this temple,1
"Gigantic mountain converted into temple .
Sure it is one of the tourist spot in Bangalore
It is better than any Iskcon temple in the world.",1
"located in a very busy area, this temple is big and peaceful.
Its bigger than the one compared to the mumbai one.
Its usually crowed on weekends, but worth visiting once",0
Nice place for Krishna devotees children and all age group will enjoy a lot . Krishna film is excellent and all can watch.,1
"Visited the place in d morning..long queue..the main mandir had breathtaking view..do look up its roof to see magnificent painting.,the idols we're draped with beautiful clothes..its a nice exp.",1

well mmaintained temple.hassle free darsan of Lord radha krishna;Enough parking space.;it would be very nice to visit in the evening around 6PM Pooja time too.,1
One of the those beautiful ISCKON temples. Enjoy the great service and meditation here. Must visit place!,0
"ISKCON is the International Society for Krishna Consciousness founded by Swami Prabhupada to propogate the teachings of Lord krishna. They are even provided escorts by the temple authority to various areas of temple which are not accessible by Indians or HindusAfter the darshan, there are many things to do in the temple complex - you can view a animation film on Krishna in the theatre or you can visit the innumerable shops to buy the various products on sale - statues, photos, books and many other items. There are many food stalls and also a restaurant. You can even buy cakes (eggless of course). And before leaving you can savour the prasad, which is delicious. Maintenance of the temple is excellent, the place is very clean and everything is well organised.",1
i visited this temple but some how i fell they are more commercialize now a days. if u enter one time u have to visit on a path direction.,1
"ISKCON temple at Bangalore is one of the city's most beautiful temples. It is situated on a hill. If you are there at the time of Aarti, you will enjoy the chants and bhajans that happen at that time. Must visit place in Bangalore once.",1
"I have visited ISKCON (Hare Krishna) temple in Yeshwantapura, Bengaluru several times over the past 10 years. I have enjoyed all of my visits, especially when I went with family for special admissions to celebrate birthday services. These devotees enjoy front row seating for the Aarti, followed by procession and enjoy a vegetarian meal prepared and served at the temple dining hall.

ISKCON temple is located conveniently to all modes of transportation. It is within walking distance of METRO STATION (Sandal Soap Factory), and near BMTS bus station. If you bring your own vehicle, after a thorough security check, you can find ample parking available at the temple site. I would recommend leaving your foot ware in the car and walking in barefoot, or you can leave it for safe keeping at the temple-run facility.

This is a place of worship like any other, but volunteers and ISKCON employees help the devotees make an orderly progress ""up"" the path to the main temple. There are several intermediate loci of worship along the way. Handicapped or elderly devotees can navigate the trip with less difficulty; you just need to inform the staff of your needs.

Krishna is traditionally worshiped by chants and singing bhajans, especially since (ISKCON) is one of the recent versions of the Bhakti movement of devotion. So, the main temple is never quiet. There is always some activity going on that involves singing (live or recorded). The Maha Aarti and Procession are lively affairs that encourages active participation by devotees. This temple is not for a devotee to practice quiet meditative prayers or contemplation; there are too many visual and aural distractions around.

Temple bookstore sells a number of books and religious memorabilia, right in the main temple (in my opinion it is a bit gauche, but deadly effective at customer capture during rapture). For those devotees who are coming for the first time, it is best to attend the evening Aarti (around 7-9 PM) to enjoy the total experience. On certain feast days and holy days, the place can get awefully crowded. However, the experience of worshipping at an orderly pace without the heat, the crowds and the rush is a truly marvelous experience.

Of course I would go back tot he ISKCON temple again.",1
This is one of the largest temple of ISKON society and also one of worth visiting places in Banglore.Just like the others it is also unique and beautiful inside. One can have a pleasant visit to this temple with friends and family . Other places nearby are few malls like orien mall and pvr vaishnavi,1
"Very nice temple. Worth a visit. Try the food here its very tasty. They also sell CD, Books, games, etc.",0
First time I have seen such a wonderful temple. entire campus was clean. It is a must visit place if you are in Bangalore.,1
"If you free go on a week days to enjoy serene atmosphere as there will less crowd. Evening arti to lord Krishna is awesome. Subsequently you can enjoy variety of North Indian, south Indian snacks.there is an excellent restaurant almost like 3 star to enjoy a good North Indian food.",1
Beautiful temple and very peaceful and welcoming. You can be a part of a service in which you get blessed and can offer gifts to Krishna. It was very interesting and unusual. I never thought I would be able to see something like that firsthand.,1
"ISKCON temple is one of the beauty of Nature. When you reach to the main temple and sits their for few minutes you feel so good that unexpressable feeling.
Beautiful chanting of Hare Krishna Hare Krishna is all around.

Thank you God to give me opportunity to be their.",1
I visited on krishna janmastami. very big queue on that day. the architecture is very nice inside. very peaceful if you go on normal days. but some things are very costly in the store inside.,1
I have been to this temple twice only but every time i find this place spritual and peaceful. Apart from spirtual experience this place offer nice food at very reasonable price along with books related to hinduism.,1
"The ISKCON temple is one of the tourist favourite in bangalore with its cultural beauty and devotional centre, it is a must visit for Bangalore visitors",1
"Had a good visit, except for the crowd.
Spend some time in temple by meditating.
Which would bring us some peace even in such huge crowd",1
"Went with family and visiting relatives. Had a good darshan. The ticket is worth it. Got a complimentary CD, Magazine and Book. The free meal afterwards isn't meant to be fine dining, but for the poor it's a gourmet spread!",1
a marvelous example of infrastructure in the center of city Bangalore. The best time to visit is definitely not the weekends. They should mention about the dress code on internet because it is very annoying after reaching there you get it know that your dress code it appropriate. rest all other thing is amazing.,1
"I visited the Temple for a numbers of time. Always feel good. The atmosphere is little-bit crowded but pleasure to visit. In the early morning, the atmosphere is quite different and really gives a different feeling. I like and love the place. There is a guest house facility for the family who wishes to stay by paying a small donation. But those who are Life Members, may stay up to three nights in free of cost. Some one, interested, may try and test. Mr. Chatterjee, Manager/Receptionist of the Guest House is very helpful and friendly. He is ready to help and doing his best for the guests.",1
the visit to iskon on 25th of march was very inspiring fulfilling and really motivating on iscon movement,1
I haven't imagined that a temple can be so big and so well organized. After entering you just have to move forward and arrangements makes sure you complete your darshan in a very fine way. Just a marvelous example of infrastructure in the center of city Bengaluru. Food Court serves you a variety with no compromise in taste and quality,0

Recommend for all",1

Nice clean place.. a mall in name of temple.. very very commercial place.. design and view is good. The fountains and plants are tastefully done!,1
"Long time ago it was a relatively peaceful place where at least one could sit on the rocks and enjoy the scene. Now it is too touristy, flashy, noisy. Avoid this if you can.",1
"I usually visit the temple during the closing time at around 8:15 pm. The pooja, bhajan and devotees dancing is enchanting!!! The prasad served is also yummy. It is usually less crowded at this time and my kids also enjoy.",1
"the architecture and temple ambience will definitely mesmerize you. it will be like a different world itself..
but after you come down stairs you feel like what in the name of god this is.. it is like a shopping mall down stairs..",1
Nice Devine place. Being weekend it was too crowded. I guess it would be better to visit on weekday... My parents really liked it a lot. Kids were not that excited however it's important for them to see and experience this.,0
"The ISKCON Temple on Chord Road is a lovely place. The temple and its environs are fairly clean which is a good thing. The temple itself is an amalgamation of several architectural styles and is made of different types of stones and marble. The galleries offer cool place to sit and view of the city. Perhaps the most spectacular is the sanctum which is golden hued and houses beautiful visages of the deities. We loved sitting here and basking in the atmosphere.

The exit takes you through several floors where the visitor runs through a gamut of wares that are for sale. After a nice experience in the main temple, this is a bit jarring. It seems like a tourist trap where the visitor/devotee is presented with so many items in the hope that they buy it. That is a pity for a place that focuses on devotion. These stalls could have been moved somewhere else. Even in all the traditional temples, shops being when the temple ends: below the exit steps.

The temple tends to be crowded. That the premises are clean despite the crowd is worth mentioning.",1
One of the best place in Bangalore. Good place for elderly peoples. Great place even for children. Also the chat centre situated at the basement is awesome. This is something that u shouldn't miss.,1
"Good place of worship..have to see at least once ...Piece of mind...Devine

We were offered the "" special "" tour, meaning it was not free admittance and that we were going on shopping tour inside the temple.
The temple itself is impressive and we spent 15 minutes to just sit down and participate in praying.",1
"The temple is a huge structure with the usual soothing and divine aura that a temple has. However once you have had the darshan, you willl slowly find the temple transforming into a commercial center, with lots of food and shopping items.

The place is highly crowded with long queues. When I went there with my family it was 3:00 in the afternoon and we had to wait till 4:00PM for the gates to open.",1

"it is located near to Mysore soap factory, 1-2 kms from yaswantpur railway station & tumkur haiway,near to Orion mall,mahalaxmi temple one among the famous temples in Bangalore.it is built in mountain type with all marble works,by walk it talks 20-30 minutes from entrance to top,vehicles are allowed on paid charges to go to the end point of the temple.there are multiple temples at each floor like good's balaji,Ganesha,etc.there is a special enters with paid charger of approximate 100- 200 per persons or group entery500 -1000,with special threats at the front of lord Krishna with sakalapam,prasadam & sort baggan,coplmetery books of choice, with group.there are book stalls, cds, snacks bar,sweets,served in the name of prasdams on paid charges.better don't buy as there is free distribution of prasdams at the ending floors which u will have to pass all the stall floors.it is added as a tourist spot in Bangalore.at evenings u can enjoy the lighting & view of city.i recommend to visit this temple to see the great architecture of temple & master piece of lord Krishna but don't encourage other things.(encourage commercial activates ).",1
Just went to take a lookout unless you are of that religion its not really worth a visit in my opinion.,1
"The temple is absolutely clean,organised and most beautiful.... The walk upto the temple very desirable as teh deities along the way give you energy and joy.",1
"Since i stay at nearby areas during business travel, i try and visit them during evenings for some spiritual time.. A very peaceful place..",0
"The place is located on a hill, very neatly kept, very disciplined crowd. Note only is the place spiritually thrilling, you get excellent vegetarian food at reasonable prices.",1
"This place is has great architecture the idol of Krishna is a treat for your eyes. On a hill top krishna temple is like a crown for the bangalore city. Amazing food served as prasadam.
One think I did not like is the quick darshan you get for a price.",1
More than a temple it's pure commercial place. Just can visit once. Nothing attached to pilgrimage value.,1
"ISKCON is not like other temples , its scenic feast to eyes when you see how the idols decorated in the best way . Bangalore ISKCON is more or less same as all ISKCON temples in India . Even if you are not a person who goes to temples every day , still you can visit this once and can have good time for sure",1
"The ISKCON Temple is certainly a must-do from my point of view. More than the religious significance, the ambience and the restaurant add charm to any visitor. One would be advised to go there when it is quieter (I do not know when!) and less hot as the heat could singe one's soles!!",0
"The temple is not like the ordinary temples with classic architecture but this is like a modern temple. I like the place for the management and clean environment.
There are lot of stalls inside for different kind of prasad, sweets. You can buy if you wish too. They also have fast food service counter, you can purchase and enjoy the taste of sweets and snacks.
There are lot of galleries for purchasing books, toys, ornaments etc.
Loved the place. Worth the visit and a must visit place.",1
"The place is calm and peaceful, love to spend time chanting lord krishna.
3d movie is available of lord krishna.",1
"I would like to say , don't go there expecting spiritual experience, you will get a commercial one ...",1
ISKCON temple has added to Bangalore s cultural heritage. Breath taking columns stone work the theme and the natural light in the temple is an example for the traditional architecture in modern times. The mode of worship the hospitality is seen to be believed. The greatest is still the Akshaya patra which is being emulated in other parts of India,1
Excellent place! Very peaceful place! We had great trip with awesome simple food give with warmth & love! Worth visiting with Family & Friends!,1
The temple is a structural beauty in the heart of the city. Great views and pleasant visit.One time visit is recommended,1
went there for the first time and was amazed with the excellent architecture. I would suggest every traveller to visit this place atleast once.,1
"This place is totally worth visiting . Have been there twice and I like the ambience .
the place is situated at a very high altitude and a person can see North Bangalore from this place . The ambience becomes quiet spiritual while chanting "" Hare Rama Hare Rame Rama Rama Hare Hare "" .

There is also a food court where you can get traditional odia and Bengali sweets and dishes . Must try for food enthusiastic .",1
"I had gone there early morning and was one of the first visitors that day. The art and architecture inside the temple premises is great. A lot of steps need to be climbed and is located above the city level. Great view of the city from the top of the temple.
Located close to the Orion Mall. The temple is well maintained and you would be lost in another world when you enter the main temple. It creates an aura of silence and devotion.",0
"ISKCON is on a mountain. We have been there several times to attend marriages etc.Veg food,authentic South Indian,is good, nice carvings n stonework. But for carvings one could try Hampi kukke Tirupathi etc.from here Orion mall is near.Awesome food cinema n boulevard etc.metro station is near. Surrounded by trashy areas. Tourists should stick to a prefixed cab if they must visit. Otherwise it's not a must visit.",1
"Even if you are not of the temple visiting kinda person when you are on vacation, i would still recommend this place. Great place.",1
"i had VIP tickets so the queue was not a problem. Peaceful place and nicely built. On rainy days and people with problem climbing stairs, just give a second thought to travel.",1
I had visited this temple last year with my friends.. Am a christian and this is the first temple am entering.. I was really excited to be there... there i could see the idols they worship and the ambience took me to some other world.. we got blessings and a tasty juice as prasadam..there were a lot of sweets available too... good experience,1
"its just like a another Iskon temple, good place to visit for peace. Disappointed a bit with too much of commercialization.",1

when u going inside the temple u have to cross 108 path by chanting

hare ram hare ram

A nice place to visit with families. A serene and clean place. Had goid and sumptuous food. Plenty of varieties of food for connoisseurs.,1
"Feels good... right from the entrance - took the steps... short ques on the day i visited, and into the main hall - peace!",1
Buffet is good. Only vegetarian food. Ambience is also good. Both South indian and North Indian items are available,1
"Beautifully built temple, well organised but it's totally into making revenue. Every thing is on sale and it feels more like a mall of worship. Pooja s are really expensive and there is special preference for people who pay more",1
"Visited the place in Jan 2016, took the regular line for darshan, please make sure you review the timings before you go there, i reached there in the afternoon not knowing and had to wait there, till visiting hours started again at 4.30pm, 3 levels up, it was an interesting experience.
Easily left my bag pack along with laptop with security ( a plus for all fellow travellers ), loved the Prasad you get after the visit, was a tasty treat.",1

"We visited this building with 2 of my groups. The buildings are all new and it seems to be the headquarters of the Hare Krishna movement in Bengaluru. There are some nice parts, but in total it made a very bussineslike impression to me.
Photography is NOT allowed and you have to leave your camera in a locker outside the Temple. You have to wear long throusers when you visit this place.I was not very impressed about the whole thing, but people with a spiritual/religious background may like it.",1
This is best place to visit in Evening. they organized very well and they have a restaurant inside the temple which offers satvik food at unbelievable rates.,1
Its near to metro station or you can book ola/uber to get here. Watch little krishna in the theater. Kheer prasadam is a must to have here.,1
"A must visit place if you are in bangalore.
Sit in the main hall and observe the minute attention to the details in the garlands to the lord or the artistic carvings in stone and gold in the temple.
Bhajans in the main hall brings out the spiritual vibe of the place. Don't miss out checking out chaat stalls on the way out of the temple.
Unlike most other places of worship, good crowd managament and cleanliness in this temple is a special mention here.",1
"Excellent experience ! Highly organised ! Blissful and well run ! Plus the cleanliness and surroundings highly impressed ! Prasadam
was divine",1
The temple is near the downtown area so it allows for some additional viewing of the city. One of many beauties in Bangalore.,1
one of the best place in Bangalore to visit. gives you peace and you feel like out of the world. beautiful architecture.,1
"I have been to the temple a couple of times now and I have to say the place is well-managed. They have a place where you can buy traditional wear (kurtas etc) and other small souvenirs. The food hall is nice and has a wide variety of sweet treats. The only point which concerned me personally was that so many people seem to visit here to simply have the food and spend time on the weekends, hence in my opinion demeaning the importance of the temple worship itself.",1
It's a good place to visit and get some peaceful time. It offers good food options at reasonable cost.,0
"This is the most beautiful and well organized temple. Even thought there is lot of visitors. its well strutctured to make the queue keep moving. Especially in the evening time lights will decorate the temple very nicely. And more importantly the shops inside the temple offering very large variety of food items at the Standard rates..

Really holy place.",1
"The temple is located very close to the Yeshwantpur railway station. It is very beautiful, clean and well maintained. Prasadam Hall has very good variety.",1
"This place is right in the middle of a busy place, but once you enter the temple, you will feel that you are in a different world. Very well maintained place and a place for peace loving people. Of course it's spiritual too, A darshan of God will swipe away all your worries and bring you back happiness.",1
"the chanting, the crowds of believers, the architecture, and the meals served to the visitors made this place a must see.",1
"Beautiful temple. Probably the best tourist attraction in Bangalore. Allow for two hours to make it through the passageway of shrines. There's lots of food options at the very end. Be prepared to leave your camera, backpacks and shoes at the entrance.",1
"The place has a blend of everything ranging from spirituality, A great architectural marvel,peaceful and a perfect place for peace of mind in a hectic place like Bangalore.The entrance to the temple and the main temple situated at the top is a fine example of architectural beauty and one would always hear the continuous chanting of Hare Krishna Hare Rama everywhere.Additionally, the basement of the temple while existing, one will be able to find numerous food stalls and shops for shopping and refreshments. photography is strictly prohibited and they conduct a lot of pujas and prayers during janmashtshi (And very crowded during this time). the temple is open during evening hours and its a must visit place in case you happen to be in Bangalore.",1
"An architectural masterpiece. A landmark for the city. A must visit for all people alike. The entire place literally transports you to a different world, full of devotion and reflection. The entire temple complex would need to be consumed through your eyes, mind and spirit, and this would need plenty of time, patience, bhakti and energy. The main prayer hall is huge and is an experience to sit through bhajans and/or pooja performances. Books, trinkets, take aways, and a myriad other Krshna products along with the rosaries and the prasadam can well be very good souvenirs for posterity. There are lots of shops selling t shirts to pens to food and one could pay attention to how they relate to the KRSHNA Consciousness and purchase accordingly. It can be quite annoying if someone is not ready, when volunteers seek donation for their several food schemes. If you have the time, just as you step out, you may seek to visit their Akshaya Patra operations area to see the massive meal scheme they run to feed millions of children. Amazing work! Amazing place! A must visit for everybody.",1
"Great Spiritual ambience! Lovely Palki Poojas, tasty prasad for the devotees. They also conduct Children's cultural camps. Wedding Hall facility.",1
"very nice experience .you can just feel the piece of mind here.
lots of food options.no TV, but for comfortable and spiritual stay this is best.",0
Very pleasant and organised crowd management! Darshan also happened pretty smooth..just keep in mind the temple closing time.,1
"I have been here a couple of times just because my family and friends wanted to visit this place. You can see all the modern elements coupled with spirituality here, The architecture is fabulous and the temple is well maintained. You could hear people chant holy verses while climbing the stairs of the temple. The interior of the temple is well decorated and it is worth spending sometime in there. You do get a feel of spirituality once you are in. However, when you proceed outside you get to see a mall like atmosphere. If you have never visited an ISKCON temple, then you can start here. Otherwise you can just visit for watching the brilliant structure of the temple.",0
"ISKCON was founded by Prahalad prabhupada, from Calcutta whom decided to spread Krishna's words.
It is a very religious place, with many rules and very little freedom to experiment one's individual spirituality. At the entrance you will find devotees promoting Pooja coupons and trying to sell offerings for Krishna, as well as cloak rooms to leave the camera and other bags. There's a lot of security checking and guards which are quite strict... All this sort of kills the enchantment of the place... But I guess its still interesting to see the shrine.
After the Pooja, visitors and devotees receive 'prasadam' in a leaf cup. And at the exit, you will find plenty of opportunities to buy gadgets, souvenirs, sweets, books.

There are different shrines dedicated to Radha and Krishna. The main temple with the golden shrine has ceiling paintings with Krishna's childhood events.
This is more a place where community religion is practised. In the evening, bhajans are played and devotees dance at the shrine.",1
"Just like other ISKON temples, this one is equally beautiful and enchanting. However, something which distracts is the commercial aspects (of selling products and artifacts), right through the sanctum sanatorium. Business of faith has always flourished, but when it comes this close, it may not go down too well with everyone. Take your call, and be prepared.",0
It is well managed commercial temple . Lot of car parking facilities are provided . We can see the ancient art forms and culture in new version.,1
"A huge architectural temple of Lord Krishna. It has 3 deities of Lord Krishna, Balarama and Radha.

One can listen to or chant Hare Rama Hare Krishna while climbing the stairs. The inner sanctum is wonderfully decorated. And the Aarti is a serene feeling.

Too commercial it is but a nice place to visit.",0
"Remarkable work with granite and marbles, it speaks volumes! Added with a silent surroundings, it is amazing!",1
It is nice a temple of Lord Krishna. We have chant matra 108 times before entering into it. The is huge and magnificent. The beauty of architecture is just is just jaw dropping. The followers of Lord Krishna must visit this place. Ya but the things inside the temple are bit costly.,1
"Since it was there in our list for long, had an opportunity as we had a marriage function in the temple. Good temple, but totally commercialized. take you car/taxi/auto and go to the top parking area, otherwise you will have to stand in big ques.",1
"Very nice, clean and big temple. Not to be missed if you are nearby or on a long (even reasonably long) trip to Bangalore. A very peaceful place with the best aarti.",1
"this is a beautiful example of Indian art, culture and Hindu religion. come here to find some inner peace and lovely vegan meals.",1
Iskcon is a huge temple of Lord Krishna and it has a beautifully blissful main sannidhi to which you've to go to chanting hare rama Hare Krishna on each of the 108 steps before the sannidhi. It is absolutely amazing if u sit there for evening aarti. There are shops here and many things have become commercialised. Wear salwar preferably. Leave your footwear in the car itself. There are two hotels in the property.,1
"Very big and nice temple I visited this place five times such a beautiful place to see and pray u will feel very calmness at this place.
Very special thing is prasadam that is big laddu.",1
"Nice location of the temple on hill
Very calm and peaceful place ...

It is very big and takes time to visit the temple. Have patience to stand in queue to worship god and after that Prasad is provided that's taste good.,1
"I have been there at least 4 times and am ever ready to visit the shrine, if anyone asks to. It's calm, peaceful and colossal, built on a small hill. It's a worth visiting place for a new comer or traveler visiting Bangalore. One may find queues during festivals and holidays. Car parking is available inside temple premises and there is dedicated place for keeping the shoes. One who may wish, can take a path chanting Hare Krishna Hare Ram (devotees direct you once you enter) or directly walk up. There are two smaller temples on the way to the main temple. The architecture is mesmerizing and the idols look gorgeous. The Sanctum Sanctorum is tranquil and soothing to mind and body. You will find devotees selling books, as you move along the exit. The exit passage takes you to the food court and you can purchase prasad along the way. They also distribute khichdi as prasad. The place is best visited during early mornings and evenings.

"I visit the temple regularly
It's a divine place and well maintained
Prasdam served to all is very blessed and tasty
Temple has one of the best kitchens with modern gadgets",1
It was good once we entered the temple. We went by cab and it took us 1.5 hr and total 3 hrs travelling to return back to the hotel.,1
My visit to this temple was in the evening. There is very big queue at the entrance. Temple was very clean and well maintained. Even though there are some issues with the queues and shoe stand. The good thing is that I felt tradition and culture which was quite missing in many temples these days. The best thing is the golden arch inside the Krishna temple. It was awesome and must visit again. My suggestion is don't try to take pictures of the golden arch(You can't hold back) security will catch you anyway.,1
"A beautiful temple which is known for its calm and cleanly surroundings..really well maintained...Wear clothes that covers till your knees or rent the clothes from there itself (which you can return after the visit).
Can be visited by people of all religion.",1
"Great location, serene location. A temple to visit and leave all our anxiety n troubles. The Idols are good, you can have your lunch at temple, or buy hygienically prepared food.",0
"We visited this place on 20 feb 16 with my wife and two kids. I was expecting this place more spiritual than commercial. From entrace they try to convince you to buy special line tickets to sell you lot of things like Donations, keychains, cloths , books and etc etc etc.. i find this place total commercial...
But apart from pushed sale it is very clean and well maintained place unlike other temple's in India.
Free prasad and afternoon meal is also available...
Overall you can visit this place to see the beautiful temple and not God",1
SUch a nice place situated in Bangalore. Very important place to be visited by tourists. Temple construction and art and paintings is mind blowing. I have visited 3 times and every time I feel great . Never Miss . Canteen is also there and so many places to be visted apart from main worship place. Prasadam is awesome,1
"one of most visit place in Bangalore,very peaceful,great feelings,take prasadam and listen sweet bhajan",1
Great feelings when ever i get the opportunity to visit Isckon Bangalore. Very peace surrounding. Tasty Prasadam.,1

Jai Shree Krishna!",0
"Iskcon at Rajaji Nagar, Bangalore, is one of the many temples run by this group not only here but accross India and abroad.

What differentiates this temple from the others is the focus on food as a part of religious activity.

Where other temples distributes only prasad or provides free food as anna dhan seva, Iskcon sells food as an commercial venture and the proceeds are re routed to the school children as mid day meals called Akshay Patra. The temple also sells books on religious teachings especially of the favoured diety ""Krishna"".",1

No great shakes.",1
"Evening view is super,with family you can visit...
Good facility,easy for darshan.
Over all nice temple,",0
"Please don't waste your time visiting this temple. If the lines and lines of people waiting to go in don't put you off walking around the food area with no shoes on will.

There is nothing much to like about this experience when you compare it to the 10000s of other temples throughout India.

They allow the masses to line up and push through the temple then you can not escape but be dragged along by the crowds into the food area where people are grabbing at food. Then as you think you have finally made it through and can see the exit you are back in grid lock with the crowd all wanted the free food offered by the temple men. As he slops it out onto your paper plate & people bump past you it will no doubt land on the floor.

Just save yourself the experience and skip this place.

Having travelled extensively throughout India on a temple run tour with a Hari Krishna I believe I know a good temple and a good vibe that is worth the effort. Clearly this isn't.

Sorry Krishna....

"It was a beautiful temple, very organised. However, I cannot understand why there is the concept of pay for quicker access? If we don't pay the ""special"" package price or so, we have to line up and walk a slightly longer and intertwining path compared to the ""express pass"". Are you trying to take money from people who just want to pray? Places of worship are not meant to make money off people. Maintenance? Take it from donations or put a standard entrance fee.",1

Somehow the temple has more selling places and appears in increasing the revenue from sales.

Worth visiting.",1
"I have visited many ISKCON temples and Bengaluru one is the one with most restrictions .. The entire path is designed in a way that you are forced to visit each outlet .. Seemed more like a mall to me ..

The only solace was the song sung by the devotees which somewhat reminded me of Vrindvan .. Was with friends so enjoyed the experience ..",1

Temple is beautifully built with the three stories. Gopuram are filled with glass. after finish of the darshan of Krishna if you plan to leave from that place you will taken to the commercial places. for regular visitors it is waste to see all commercials.,0

"A spacious temple in RBI colony near Brigade millennium in Puttenhalli. The idol is very nice and the psllaki seva on Saturday is a delight to watch. There were about 200 people and there is ample place for all to get darshan There are chairs also. Free prasadam( puliyogare) was given to all.
Worth a visit.

On these days the temple looks very crowdy and you will feel blessed and happy with your friends and family.

The statue of the Lord Krishna and radha are good which is of gold.

Also near to that ORION MALL is there so that you can spend some time in mall and by sitting near World trade centre.",1
Did not feel as temple its more of commercial place. You have paid darshan as well and its crowded for free .Personaly not a support of Paid darshan.,1
"1) Disciplined in all terms, good security check, cleanliness maintained well, food stalls good, anna dhana offer good, deity sanctum santorium very very divine.
2) Entry to exit its well structured. Also the systematic approach to be in queue for foot wear deposit and collection, and darshan.s of different deity is good
3) The chanting of lords name in each step during darshan is amazing",1
"It is absolutely beautiful place. There is no entrance fee, but they have donation boxes inside the temple which look like a telephone booth. They have a restaurant whose name is ""Taste of Gods"" and they sell Italian foods. Maybe their gods are Ancient Romans.",1

"It is absolutely beautiful place. There is no entrance fee, but they have donation boxes inside the temple which look like a telephone booth. They have a restaurant whose name is ""Taste of Gods"" and they sell Italian foods. Maybe their gods are Ancient Romans.",1
Anyone visiting bangalore must ensure a visit to this temple. It is so beautiful and serene.The moment you enter the main gate you can feel the presence of the Lord .Beautiful idols of God.,1
"its a Krishna temple though you wont get religious feeling here, but nice place to time pass. its like a commercial place.",1
"Its more of tourist stops than a temple, good for one time visit. Don't like the shopping mall type exp.",1
"Bangalore has some very beautiful temples throughout the city, though if you are in the vicinity of this one, it is a must see",1
Iskcon banglore must visit..u fil the peace of mind whem u enter of main temple..u require atlist 2 hrs for seen this temple.. Ye nai dekha to kuch nahi dekha...must go..and must visot in evening time.,1
"Well maintained, clean and very popular with tourists. Chant 'hare rama....' 100 times before entry. Peaceful place. Visit the souvenier shops and food stalls later and experience a good day out with family.",1
I went there once for the morning arati.. We were early for a conference at Vivanta by Taj so we went there around 8 am to attend the Arati.. The temple is beautiful both inside and outside.. The arati is awesome guys.. I loved the dancing brahmacharis and the best part is you can join the dance and music!,0
"Going to this temple every year on my wife Bday , you will impressed with the cleanliness of the premises and the rich marble architecture .

God darshan and bhajan atmosphere will take you to different world , enjoy the best by being calm and focus mind on your God you love within temple .

The shopping outlets serve you the best quality sweets and bakery items and even lot of hand made crafts available .

The prices looks more , but it has hidden charity events cost in if. Iskon need to be appreciated for the akshaya patra initiative , serving food for poor.",1
One is a while when you are bored of the crazy weekend parties and fine dine with corporate colleagues; Coming to this temple will make you feel calm and peaceful.,1
If you visit the place at the time of aarti you are sure to feel rejuvenated. Sometimes it is over crowded but still you are sure to feel lively.,1
Beautiful temple inside but once you leave the main inside area you walk through so many tables/shopping areas it is overwhelming. So expect 90% vendors selling goods and 10% temple experience. Worth seeing once but not a true spiritual serene experience due to the massive shopping area.,1
This is one more awesome place in Bangalore. Especially when you enter and you stand in the Que chanting Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare - Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare. You feel there is some power touching you and you are surrendering to it. Must visit place.,1
I visited the ISKCON mandir with a friend and found it very disappointing. The temple was nice but the entire experience was much too commercial. At every step we were being asked to either donate or buy something. The temple was at the top of the structure and to exit you are forced to walk through all the rooms and areas where they are selling merchandise and food. It was akin to going to an IKEA where you have to pass through everything before you can leave. My experience was not very spiritual.,1
You get good peace of mind when you visit ISKCON. Do visit this beautiful temple. The hot pongal served post darshan is yummy too.,1
"Well, i though it will be much impressive. A lot of people, please, take care-you'll have to go by bare feet.Basically, the temple looks good, though it's a new one, not ancient. But inside you'll suffer from a lot of people selling different stuff...sweets, books, candles...The Krishna guys are famous for feeding poor people and repeating the same words the whole day..That's it.",1
"Although we were the only tourists in the temple when we visited it, this temple is highly organized for tourists and the local community. We had to leave our shoes at the entrance and walk through a path all the way up to the temple. After you visit the temple, you walk again through a path that leads you to the souvenir shops, canteen (they offer free food) and get to the end of the journey in the shoes collection. The temple is huge, and no photos are permitted. But even though we couldn't record any memory from this place, I will never forget it. The atmosphere is very intense, and very peaceful.",0
"The temple makes u go back again and again. Peaceful. When one hears hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare..... The chants keep resonating when one enters the temple.

I recommend taking the 108 hari naam steps.",0
"I love the place, very good indeed. you will find peace of mind. they have some food corner in there, where vegetarian food is too good.",1
Iskcon temples across India are well maintained and easily accessible to visitors and non-localites.,1
It is one of the very good ISKCON temples I have visited. The bhawan is beautifully designed and the whole atmosphere is good,1
"after a hectic, heavy project our assit. Manager took us here. Very Big temple. It took half-an-hour to pass through the queue. there were 108 steps (marble plates) on which u'd asked to step on each one saying the hymn and going forward on one-by-one. its was very good. after darshan, felt akward that there is huge store of protraits, stautes, snacks(prasadams), stickers, toy, untensils for puja and all. it was a mini mall there. and near the back gate we can find many stalls of several kind of junk food. people eat there, wash there hands there itself and for a while forget that it is a temple indeed.",1
"Devine place. Must visit with elders in your family. Have car/bike parking place with decent price. One can see the idols right in front. Take a family entry ticket, with that you can see the gods right in front in all 5 temples.",1
If you believe in God search the almighty in your heart rather than come down to this place.God is sold in stickers toys and cds.Commercialization of religion at its worse,1
"The ISKCON temple is a beautiful temple in a city that has many beautiful places to worship in. Situated on the top of a hill you get there by climbing up the steps from the street.
The facility is also super friendly to people with limited access - they have wheel chairs and ramps and will also take pains to ensure that people in wheel chairs get a good darshan.
There are several eating places on onsite all of which are clean and offer pure vegetarian food.",0
Very serine and most well maintained Morden day temple. It's one of must visit venue of bangalore. Make sure to take children to this temple and experiance unique theatre showcasing Sri Krishna Leela movies all days.,1
ISKCON Sri Radha Krishna is a really good place with a great sculpture work. This temple covers a very large area. It reminds us about the stories of Lord Krishna. The devotional bhajans and prayers gave us a different experience. And this premises has got such a large prasad area. Had a very good time with family.,1
Very sacred place. You feel like being with the god. The Aarti time is an occasion to dance to the most wonderful tune of Hare Krishna.,1
"Iskcon temple of Bangalore is at the north end of Bangalore very close to Orion Mall. The temple is huge and stands overlooking the city of Bangalore. However, unlike other Iskcon temples, this temple was totally commercialized and it took me 15-20 mins to find my way out. This is because as soon as you leave the main temple and follow the exit route, you pass through myriad of shops and stalls inducing you to buy either books, prasad, branded Iskcon calendar & diaries, eateries, etc. It looks more like a marketplace brimming with buyers and sellers rather than an abode of God. This temple was highly disappointing.",1
We visited this temple in May. Its a beautifully sculpted temple situated on a hillock and provides great views of areas around. The insides too are worth watching though I was a little put off by all the commercial activities going on inside. Buy only if you need to. The prasadam is given at the end after one has gone through the entire gamut of shops housed inside the temple. They give free langar / lunch coupons daily at 11:00 am so plan accordingly.,1
"This temple is huge and made of marble & granite which is quite pleasing to look at. I have been visiting the temple since it was initially built. Although, it had gotten little commercialized in recent years, its still a must visit place in Bengaluru. Avoid festivals & holy days if you want to avoid crowds.",1
Its an interesting temple with a rather new design(that is if you compare it to the olden temples around the city). But the devotees at the temple celebrate worshipping Krishna in a good way. Just stay away from the sales guys trying to sell you books and other goods within the main temple. I found that rather annoying.,1
It was simply wow.. peaceful temple.. one of the largest ISKCON temples that I have visited.. clean and organised..will go again everytime I visit Bengaluru...,1
Temple built on a small Hill. Well maintained by the Temple authority. Cafeteria has food without Onion and garlic. Nowadays temple has transformed to a kind of commercial place yet it is good place to visit for peace of mind,1
"You come here and find peace.
A must if you love to see temples and that too an Iskcon one.
Been here twice , made my Mom have a darshan in January.
Very big but dont worry , you get a wheel chair and special entry for Senior citizens.",1
"A very peaceful place to spend time - extremely clean... but I personally believe this is not a great place to meditate, due to the amount of noise (lot of people visiting) and the singing that goes on. The biggest attraction is Palki Utshav (around 7 PM, putting the God to sleep for the night) and the morning arati (I forget the name of the ritual). The food in the in house restaurant is also delicious - pure veg food though. I enjoy the place very much",1
Love ISKCON mainly because it takes out all the stress that has accumulated in me since my last visit here. It obviously is a great temple. I feel very much happy and relieved after every visit. Have attended a few programes too. Truely a special place.,1
"I wrote this as 'unusual temple' for a reason. I won't be able to compare it with any other traditional temple structure like Chola,Vesara or Chalukya. I visited this temple couple of times. I always see this temple as a commercial organization than as a religious place. Anyway the place is silent even though it is located in the heart of the city.",1
"We were there for chanting and prayers which I found to be quite an emotional experience. It is a large temple with lots of people, and there is an element of commercialism at the temple with the shops. However, considering the free lunches and support the temple gives to the local communities, this is understandable. Very glad we visited the temple. A great experience!",1
"I visited this large temple complex devoted to Krishna within the city centre. No cameras are allowed to be used but you can use your mobile to take photos. Footwear must be removed before entering the temple area. There are quite a number of steps to climb before reaching the main worshipping area. The temple is very clean and neat. It appears to be a fairly new temple compared to others I visited and according to my guide, is supported by donations worldwide. I have to say that although it was a large complex I wasn't impressed either by the inside or the out. I was left with the impression that it was more of a business venture rather than a spiritual one; but still worth a visit even just for the photo opportunity.",0
"Nice place to visit whenever you feel like city life is taking a toll on you.
Its very very peaceful.",1
"This is one of the nice temple which gives relaxation n peace of mind. Less crowd on weekdays. On weekends all the places u can expect the crowd, so here also u can expect the same.",1
"Visited the temple with friends and family. I was first fascinated by the scale and then by the decorative work done inside the main temple.
The variety of food options available is also huge and especially considering inside a temple.
Overall a good place to visit and spend time on an evening.",1
It is a very nice Temple. Orion Mall is nearby. Metro train from Mantri Square can be taken to reach it. The toilet near the shoe /slipper care centre is very small compared to the number of visitors visiting the place.,1
"Imagine having chinese food without onion and garlic and pastries without egg-this is the place to visit.Besides south indian food ,the chinese noodles with gobi manchurian was very tasty.Hot malpuas and other icecreams were the highlight of food at this place",1
This temple is one of the must visit places in bangalore for its unique beauty and arrangements. The temple is located on top a hill and the view of the surroundings from the temple is awesome.,1
the temple is well built and maintained ...and we can take friends from outside India to see it and they loved it ..also offers delicious food,1
"If you are in bangalore, plan a visit to iskon temple. Well maintained, neat and clean. Beautiful architecture and a great feeling when you are inside the main temple.",1
"A beautiful ISKCON temple out of chain of such temples all over world. Very well organised & maintained. Facilities for devotees are plenty. All details are meticulously planned & executed. Devotees are offered various services like classes on Gita, prasadam, film show on Sri Krishna, guest house, number of satvik cafeterias meeting individual choice & liking which is very rarely seen in any temple.",1
"More than lord krishna, i could remember only pav bhajji, samosa center, shopping centers,etc.. i would say they should stop commercializing iskcon temple. I dont recommend for people to go if they are planning for peace of mind, just go if you are planning for any shopping and eating",1
"Loved our visit to the temple. Felt closer to the almighty.
Very well managed and cooperative and helpful staff and volunteers make your visit especially with elders peaceful and comfortable. Not much preference given to big shots and no asking for money anywhere. You can contribute voluntarily by purchasing things at the shops on the complex.
We were a group that had many elders and the staff supported us by letting us bring the vehicle to the top, using the lift. Good arrangements for seniors even on a very crowded day on which the beautiful rath yatra was bring held.",0
"It was really a unique experience to visit this temple with thousands of locals. You can see many Indian gods and how people pray to them. At the end you can buy some sweets or incenses, sandal sticks are highly recommended.",1
"Cool place to visit, mix of religious and modern flavors, their prasadam is a must to eat. Look for timings and rush before u plan to go",1

Iskon temple is near yesvantpur railway station. The temple is clean and runs systematically. But duing exit there are too many shops in the name of business. Avoid them,0
"The temple was huge and one can get darshan of Narshimha, Venkateshwara, Nitai Gauranga, Balrama and of course Radha-Krishna ! The temple is crowded during the evenings but with a NO PHOTOGRAPHY policy inside the temple and spacious halls, you can always have a quicker darshan. There is ample place for you to sit down and meditate, particularly in the morning when the crowd is less. The sandhya aarti starts at 7pm and it was amazing. The last aarti for the day is at 8.30pm and the idols are moved through the public into the inner sanctum by the priests. It was mesmerizing to witness all this !

There are many stalls selling Gita and other books in multiple languages, idols, paintings, Krishna T-shirts and other items after you exit the main temple. There are many food stalls too. There is a shortcut way to avoid visiting these stalls for those in a hurry. The temple offers free prasadam near the exit from the temple complex. There is a restaurant near this exit but the variety of food is far too less here.

The number of buses that ply on this road is less, so go for a break journey via Majestic.",1
"The whole institution commercialised krishnas name and knows nothing of krishna or the bhagvad geeta,they are just using the name of krishna to get popular with their own stupid version of the gita. But the way the temple us constructed is cool can go there for sight seeing but not a spiritual experience",1
The entry to the temple was as usual thru security who screened your car and then let you to the top of the hill as you wind up your enthusiasm to meet the lord increases as you her the chanting Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Hare Hare - Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare - as you enter the temple the bhajans and the dancing by the resident devotees takes you into a trance and mesmerises you to deep meditation,0
The temple is located near the orion mall. The temple has very pleasant environment where we can forget all our issues and relax well.,1
"Must visit place in Bengaluru.
Peaceful.
Fall in love with Krishna.
Great food and prasadam.
Nice and must attend Aarti",0
The temple is wonderfully built and maintained. Its blissful experience in the main hall.The food they serve in the food shop is excellent.,1
Great place to go for worship and fun. The big hall at lord Krishna statue is good place to sit for some minutes to feel peace. Can buy lot of souvenirs related to lord Krishna. Have ample food stalls as well if you feel hungry.,1
Good place to visit. One of the best temples of Bangalore. Morning time is better as evenings tends to get a little rush.,1
"Please visit on weekday
Weekend is very crotasty
Recommend you to eat khichdi very very tasty
Transport needs to be changed from majestic",1
Why Temple City --- Not only the Temple you will like its also the whole city you will get to see ....,1
"I visited this temple in January 2016, more as someone wanting to eat at their fine-dining restaurant - The Higher Taste.

This is a modern iconic site, a must visit site, whether you are a devotee or not.

There is parking space available and the visitors/ devotees are taken through the temple through organized queues. There is a low-cost eating joint as well as a fine-dining restaurant.

The place is well-managed and is also involved in a lot of charitable work.

Their famous charity is providing free cooked lunch to school kids studying in many Government schools under the brand AKSHAYA PATRA. This scheme improves attendance of school among kids from economically backward families. The hot lunch is cooked and delivered to the schools using a fleet of vans and trucks.",1
One of the best places to visit in Bengaluru. The environment here will grip you in complete peace and divine love for lord Krishna,1
"A very beautiful Radha-Krishna temple, a must visit atleast once if you are in Bangalore. I have visited many times, feel good in it's peaceful and serene atmosphere in the chaotic city life.",1
Nice Temple with nice location and nice view. Hill top view. Nice prasadam. Special prasadam with low price with very good quality.,1
"I had been here before and its my 2nd visit. If you are not a devotee too, you are permitted to enter the place. Theres a calm atmosphere around.",1
"Facilities, Infrastructure, arrangements are very good. 5/5. But this temple is too much commercialized. if you have money, you will get priority for DARSHAN which is 180 degree opposite of the concept of the temple. for this 0/5.",1
Excellent and Nice place to visit. We were blessed to have Guruji in the Ashram when we visited. The bus tour in the ashram was exciting and was nicely planned.,0
This is a must visit in bangalore. Its closed from 1 to 4 pm so plan accordingly. very well managed. shorts are not allowed but they provide you with a mundu. so explore and enjoy,1

"Iskcon Bangalore is situated on hill top quite high where to reach you need to climb many stairs upto atleast 20 minutes. Its is beautifully made and the main hall to the Radha-Krishna temple is absolutely on the top. while you come out of temple you go through a long long never ending array of shops selling religious stuff like calenders, bags etc etc. Then you have an arena where delicious snacks are served at a very minimum prices of 20-35 rupees range. They are required keeping in view your mountain climb for so long. you can choose from an ample variety of menu, which is not only delicious but healthy as well. well suited to any taste, even our foreigner guests too.",1

They have restaurant inside the temple also which is very famous for its food.",1
This is one of the finest Krishna temple to visit in Bangalore and it is worth seeing if you are in Bangalore,1
So much crowd that you should have spare time for about 1 - 2 hours for waiting leave aside the time you spend inside. Traffic iaschaotic to reach the place and return back to your place of stay. Do not ask fro parking.,1
"Its Big Grand temple of Krishna by ISKON.
Best time to visit this temple is morning 7:00.At that time Pooja should not be missed.",1
"Best place to visit for inner peace ! You can spend peaceful time in the midst of the Lord , perfect for devotees",1
"Located at Rajajinagar, Built over a Hill (Hare Krishna Hill), this ISKCON Sri Sri Radha Krishna Chandra temple is one of the biggest ones with an amazing blend of modern + old architecture. Opulent Deities of Sri Lakshmi Narasimha, Sri Garudadev & Sri Hanuman, Sri Srinivasa Govinda, Sri Sri Radha Krishna Chandra, Sri Sri Krishna Balaram, Sri Panca Tattva, Srila Prabhupada are a delight to have darshan of. A must visit for all ages alike, specials on Sundays and festivals. One can do spiritual shopping, have sumptuous sattvik prasadam at the stalls or even at the two restaurants which are located in the premises, one can enjoy nice chanting and meditation, listen to nice spiritual kirtans & lectures, watch movies on Krishna,.",1
"The modern building is interesting. When you are inside the temple is white with a spacious hall where people sit and sing. But in the same hall there are monks selling books and it doesn t seem so spiritual. On the way to the exit, you pass a long market with people selling any sort of merchandising. Even if you don t want to buy, you buy something. Never seen in any other temple in the world.",1
A must visit when in bengaluru ..the ISCKON temple is a beautiful Radh Krishna temple situated in between the city ....a visit in the evening is better ..with all the lights and fountains i is a beautiful sight .....the temple complex is huge ... and there is a shopping complex a theatre and museum .,1
"Really beautiful, nice area around the temple as well. People are very considerate. Breath taking during festival time. Very approachable, really worth the trip for both devotees and tourists.",1
"Its a multiplex temple.Some people may feel it more commercial.As it is under ISKCON it promotes Krishna Consciousness in every means dats all.There is a theatre,sattvic diet restuarant,distribution of books by Srila Prabupada,RadhaKrishna posters and so on.A must visit for any Krsna devotee.YOU CAN CHANT HARE KRSNA AND BE HAPPY DERE! :)",1
"Same as any other ISKCON temple, with lot of commercialization which is a norm nowadays in ISKCON. People who like temples will like it anyways, architecture wise pretty normal. For those seeking peace, crowd and commercial stalls are going to make it very tough.",1
"Opulence and grandeur, two words best describe the sanctum. Long lines and human paraphernalia managing things inside are not welcoming, but gazing at the The Almighty creates a lasting impact on all souls.",1
"The most beautiful temple of Bangalore and so Much big area.
You can get to see Lord Krishna with all the gold in full.
Also lord Krishna every thing about childhood days.
Also the prasadam was too much good for taste.
Inside the weather is so much cool.
You will feel like you were sourrouded by all the gods.",1
"Too crowded. Not worth visiting it. better be at home and prey to God rather than spending time and getting restless.

It is too crowded and you will not get to see God even for few minutes. If you are really looking for peace of mind then stay back at home and do meditation and prey to God in home. Atleast you will have peace of mind.",1
Good temple structure. But it might not be worth the 3-4 hours you will spend in driving up to the place and walking up the lines. Moreover you are unlikely to know the darshan timing and even if you know it you can barely manage to plan your time with the unpredicable traffic conditions etc,1
I went here with my parents and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. The temple occupies a large area and it is peaceful inside. A must visit if you are in Bangalore!,1
"We visited the Radha Krishna temple of ISKCON on 29th December 2015.I teach in Scottish Church College of Kolkata and an alumnus of Scottish Church, Shri Prabhupada Swamy, known formerly as Abhay Churn Dey created the temple.It is situated on a Hill and the ambience is calm, quite and very much religious. The deities are beautiful. The shrine is crowded but the crowd is disciplined.",0
"I had an opportunity with family, to be present at evening Aarthi time and it was an event of dedication, a total surrender to Lord Krishna, we like to visit again and possibly again!
Lord Krishna!",1
One of the best temple in banglore . Huge crowd to be seen came for blessings and prayers. ......hare Krishana .....,1
I had heard a lot about the ISKCON temple in bangalore and finally got a chance to visit.. beautiful temple on a hill overlooking the city. must visit..,1
"Ambiance is good, but it is less peaceful because of crowd.
Entering & Exit also takes time even though the campus is not very big.",1
"Very first-time been here. The experience is beyond explanation by words. One must visit here to understand it. Car Parking available. Plenty of handicrafts shopping inside the temple. Food available for purchase. We have taken the special entry ticket for which they give a free book, prasadham. Best time to visit is morning and evening.",1
"While the temple premises is clean and the deities look majestic, there are shops and more shops to rip your pockets. Its more like a family picnic spot than a temple.",1
"I suggest buying VIP pass for 300 rupees for four people. It's their equivalent to fast pass, or ""direct darshan"" as I like to call it (trademarked).

The experience was wonderful, live chanting and music was played throughout. Everyone was very helpful and friendly especially when my foreigner girlfriend was desperate for a bathroom. And we got individually blessed by name from one of the Rishis there.

The temple is gorgeous, with an awe inspiring golden mandir, and some murtis that seen alive with joyous energy.

Go get that darshan, son!",1
"If you are in for a spiritual trip the ISKCON is a must.India is a place for spirituality.The devotion and commitment with which the temple pujas are performed is something to experience it yourself.The clean environment, and the systematic ques and darshan is something amazing.

I have visited the temple more than 5 times when I was in Banglore. Such a perfect place to be relax and learn the life - meaning....

It is another landmark where you must visit in the life time. I have attached few images for your convenience..

Om...",1
"I often visit this temple, as most of my family who stays in hometown and comes to Bangalore for the first time. this would be the main attraction for them. I have to take them.

The place is neat and clean. Well maintained by the staff and volunteers. The shoe stand was weel planned. the way to reach the main temple will take more than 15-20 mins. If you are visiting the temple on weekends and holidays, the queue will be more.

But the main hall in the temple feels so artificial. Ideally lot of people will get the intense feeling of temple atmosphere. other than that the temple is a nice place.

The stalls in the exit way sells few of the handcrafted article and cloths. paintings and home decorative items.

You can taste some yummy food stuff prepared in the ISCKON kitchen(it is paid) and at the end, you will get a free prasada in the exit point.

It would take about one hour to complete this.",0
"Like with any other Hindu temple, keep in mind the temple and aarati timings. For elderly and slightly disabled, there is a lift that can be accessed by car from the other entrance. There's plenty that can be bought at affordable prices inside, like souvenirs, food and clothes.",1
Everything is well managed and signboards made sure that no one has to ask anyone to visit such a big and beautiful temple.,0
"I had previously never visited any ISKCON temple.
This was my first time

"Recommended to visit this place at around 7:45 PM in night when Aarti is done. During Diwali period they organize deepotsava, its worth visiting at that time.",1
"Comparing this temple to other ISCKON temples across India - this would be the lowest ranking. Nothing exceptional. If visiting, try going in the evening around sunset to enjoy the beautiful city views and the lights on the temple.",1
A very good Temple........:-) must visitable place with family or friends good maintenance is maintained;-),0
This place is within the city limits.. hence choosing the time of day is important... we prefer to visit the place on normal days by 11 AM to get an sober darshan.. prasad.. relax time inside the temple.. and then the food in the restaurant (which is free till 1 PM) on regular day. Good for some memorabilia from the shops within the premises... Parking is not a problem.,1
"The ISKCON temple on cord road is the biggest in Bangalore.If you are in for a spiritual trip the ISKCON is a must.India is a place for spirituality.The devotion and commitment with which the temple pujas are performed is something to experience it yourself.The clean environment, and the systematic ques and darshan is something amazing.You have volunteers all along to guide you and to answer any queries you have.The idols of Radha and Krishna,Balarama are beautifully decorated and radiates peace.There are a number of books awaliable, written by various authors on the Bhagawat Gita. the life of Lord Krishna,and Sri Prabhopadaji the founder of the ISKCON (International society for Krishna Consciousness) The restaurant here serves the best vegetarian food. You can buy snakes at the food court too.So this is one place you must not miss when you are in Bangalore.",1
Iskcon temple is superb temple in Bangalore . they are developing another temple at kanakapura road .,1
Been to this place with my family and it was such a nice trip. The place was not so crowded when i visited.After a short walk through a narrow queue you can reach the Lord Venkateswara temple and further walk leads you to radha-krishna temple. The interesting story is the temple is well maintained and clean. Fact i learned is that the idols are decorated with costumes designed and tailored by Islamic craftsman. They serve free food as well. Good amount of parking space is available and is walk-able from Orion mall.,1

"The ISKCON temple atop a hillock in Mahalaxmi Layout is a landmark in itself. It is a modern temple built with inspiring architecture with all modern facilities for the pilgrim. The temple complex has a place for tourists to stay, a vegetarian dining hall where Lord Krishna prasadam is served for the devotees, a restaurant called Higher Taste which is a multi cuisine vegetarian restaurant, multimedia rooms etc.

The major deities in this temple are Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Krishna Balarama, Nitai Gauranga, Srinivasa Govinda, Prahlada Narasimha.

All pujas are performed with great religious fervour and all the Indian festivals are celebrated with great pomp and show. Spiritual Discourses are delivered regularly for the benefit of pilgrims on various topics relating to Indian culture.",1
All Bangaloreans are pretty much well-known to iskon. Love the whole architecture and feel of the temple. Spending an hour time here give u so much of relaxation.,0
We had been there to attend a marriage. I have been here several times to attend marriage reception. I like the temple style food here. The idlis are soft and delicious. Food is the best part. The marriage halls are spacious and clean.,1
"Visit in the evening - and stay back for the aarti
Try and avoid the special pooja days when the place can be very crowded",1
"Located on a hilltop this temple draws huge crowds every day and specially on festive occasions. The entire process in reaching the temple altars is a spiritual experience chanting the mantra all the way. For senior citizens unable to climb the steps, lifts are available to reach you right inside the temple's sanctum sanctorum. Darshan is orderly and there is no pushing. For those interested in shopping for curios plenty of puja items to pick up for home and as gifts for family. There are restaurants inside the premises serving all types of cuisines.",1
"A beautiful Hindu experience for all religions. The Hare Rama Hare Krishna chants fills the air with an essence of something very potent and poignant. Reaching the main temple on a hill top you go through hop, scotch and jump exercise which is fun.",1
Best to visit in the evening and stay there till 8:30 pm to see the special puja and also awesome view of Orion mall from ISKCON hill,1
Its really a nice temple to visit and spend time in.. really enjoyed the times I visited there and easily accessible through the bus and now the metro,1
What a lovely and calm place.You can enjoy nice and calm environment with lovely vegetarian food in the temple.,0
"Very big temple.
Temple area is clean and well maintained
Long queues are there for darshan
Prasad and eatables are offered at end of darshan",1
"Beautifully designed, decorated . The nice way to get the day is goin early with a relaxed mind and enjoy the darshan of the lord with a tranquilizing mind. U will enjoi this. U will be able to connect yourself to the lord. The pongal prasadam is yummy. This is the best I have tasted. The shops I feel are all commercial. The overall experience is too good to be missed.",1
"during visit to Bangalore, one must eat at Iscon sri radha-krishna chandra temple and enjoy simple and vegetarious food",1
Visit to this place gives u serene satisfaction and pleasure.. Appreciate the way the entire campus is maintained.. Should be lucky to visit ISKON,1
ISKCON Bangalore is well laid out and a beautiful structure with a well managed crowd control system. The architecture is impressive and the prasadam is superb!,1
one of the best attraction in Bangalore.... who ever visiting Bangalore must visit this place..... I visited with family and with friends also...... mix of spiritual and commercial place to buy hand crafts.....,1
"we had gone to this temple on vikunta ekadashi day,very rush but very professionally handled by Iskon managment.",0
"Very subtle and scenic location. Recommended to connect with your inner self at any time
This place has a great historic recommendation",1
"A fantastic temple of Radha Krishna. Plus the food there is excellent. You can buy all sort of stuff such as tshirts, organic products, gift items etc. Must visit if in Bengaluru.",0
"I been to this temple twice . Good temple and nice to go with family and friends.

I am sure this will get you peace.",1
"This place is a very nice tourist attraction in bangalore. The entrance is free, pay only if you want to take snaps inside the temple complex. The prasadam is delicious. It's good they now allow you to exit directly without having to go through the food stall and shopping area.",1
temple to visit at least once in your life. you can sit and meditate when its not the festival time.,1
The temple is huge very clean and the deities are amazing. the only negative point is you have to pay to get inside while i tend to think that walking in a temple should be free. But i certainly understand that there could be a cost for maintaining such a divine place. Prasad and coupons to purchase books was freely offered though. Unfortunately cameras were not allowed and even bags had to be kept at security.,1
"Good location, extremely serene. Best part is the Maha Aarthi and you become one with the Lord. Make sure you go in the evenings.",0
"The ""Hare Krishna Hare Radha"" chants inside the temple complex along with the beautifully painted interior roofs create a mesmerizing effect on the soul. You can buy a lot of good books and merchandize too here. The food stalls before the exit.",1
This place is a must visit to who ever comes to Bangalore. Love the ambience and the prasad. the place is easily accessible by public transport.,1
"the great temple known for architectural bonanza is situated on top of a hill from where you can see beautiful bangalore.you get elevated yourself as you climb the hill and once you enter the sanctum sanctorium lo you really forget the world.here you will definitely say OMG! .Buy Srimad bhagvad geeta, Sri Bhagavatham, by Swami Prabhu Pada the founder of ISKON. On top it you will fulfill your taste buds by varieties snacks, north/south Indian delicacies ,sweets. Buy good souvenirs, enjoy life.",1
"very holy & magical place in the heart of Banglore, a bit different ,than other temples I visited, was a bit cowdy during Sunday",1
Have been there a number of times - nice temple that you can visit in Bangalore even if you are not all that religious.. pretty well maintained and overall the experience is very good.,1
"If you need to learn about India culture, you should find some time to visit Iskcon Temple. It is very interesting to walk through all the routine by take off your shoe, wash your feet, follow the rout which is leaded to the series of gods and to the main temple. In side the main building is very interesting, a monk will perform some ceremony for the prayer and you can sit down and observe the whole time. I love the atmosphere which is very mystical and faithful.",0
"Beautiful premises with divine vibes. The management is excellent starting from the point you enter till you exit getting the prasadam (holy food). The ""Hare Krishna Hare Radha"" chants inside the temple complex along with the beautifully painted interior roofs create a mesmerizing effect on the soul. You can buy a lot of good books and merchandize too here. The food stalls before the exit with a variety of healthy and all vegetarian preperations are not to be missed.",1
Its the 1st iskon temple ive visted and yes i fell a pure devotion and chants come all around the temple. We forget ourself and start chanting with the ridham of hara ram hara krishna krishna krishna hara hara.,1
"Hi folks,

This place is a good place and a must visit for all Bangaloreans and visitors.
Location is also near to city bus stops, railway stations and metro station, so commutation is not a problem at all. The temple is designed in a very nice manner and the entrance is well organized with a very neat maintenance. The interiors are very beautiful. And the 3 mini mandirs within the main temple where the God's idols are placed have been designed very nicely. But once you are done with the worships, you are directed to follow a return path that will let you enter an exhibition sort of arrangement which is nothing but solely business carried by the authority. It depends on one's mentality, and it seems pure business to me. Keep this apart, as it may be fascinating to people who may get all decorative items for their puja rooms, of course at a big price. The view of outside area from the temple is great. Preferably evening hours are the best time to visit this place.
Food is available in the temple premises, mostly snacks of all types.
Don't forget to collect the cute photographs of the Lord and of course the prasad - khichdi. But your ears will hear only Krishna chants which itself is great for all human beings.",1
The Iskcon Sri Radha Krishna Temple is a cultural complex along with a huge temple and some small temples in the adjacent. All the temples are dedicated to different deities of Radha Krishna. The temple complex is a very peaceful place with a wonderful ambiance.,1
"Very good and beautiful temple. But, I was feeling tired after reaching there from such a long journey from K R Puram to ISKCON. Temple was about to close (08:30 PM).",1
Been there with family and was wowed by the neatness and calmness of the place. Had nice snack counters as well to munch up the appetite.,1
the food available there is satvik but really sumptious ...the buffet has north indian and as well as chinese food ....its very ecomonical also,1
"A beautiful temple with serene and quiet atmosphere built on a rocky area. A great place to meditate. Even if you are not a follower of ISKCON, the temple complex is worth your time to visit. Only caution - you have to walk a bit and it has some simple gradients though with marble flooring there is no problem to walk. Wheel chair facilities available at Reception. Also has a lovely cafeteria - food & beverages are good & tasty.",1
ok - commercial temple ......... good view and interiors and devine smell .... What I love here is the Prasadam - lovely HOT and tasty,1
"For one thing, this temple is just too far even if you live in Bangalore. The thing is, it is less of a temple and more of a mini-mall. They have food, shopping, movies - not the kind of things you would associate with a temple or with spirituality. It's also crowded, so you get the feeling that you're being rushed. Again - not a very temple-like feeling to be rushed. Temples should be peaceful, isn't it?",1
"I have seen this temple from the time it started from a scratch till the date. It is undoubtedly a marvelous piece of engineering and spiritual workmanship. You can get lost in its vast and beautiful architecture. If you are interested in spiritual pursuits, this is one place to stop by. Not just spirituality, a great place to feel the calm in the noisy life we lead, serene and captivating architecture. Good food awaits at the restaurants in the complex and also items of worshiping Hindu deities, spiritual music, paintings literature and knowledge of highest quality are available for owning. Some entertainment for the kids and grown ups in a theater that shows animates series on life of Krishna.
Do not miss the mediation path just before you enter the temple. There is a set of granite slabs laid out in and you are expected to chant 'Hare Krishna' mantra every time you step on each of them... takes another 15 to 20 minutes more than the general entry, but worth the time you spend chanting. The advise is that you chant the ""Hare Krishna"" mantra, yet I have chanted a variety of mantras of my choice.

The only time I have felt uneasy was the time I accompanied a friend from Germany, where the volunteers made her feel slightly uncomfortable with the donations for their mid day meals scheme.",1
"Good place to seek refuge in the splendour of god listening to chants.

Close your eyes and be to oneself in the devotional setting.

This place is for one and all. Edifices the glory of almighty.",1
"This temple is an attraction of the city and one should visit it once for sure. Parking should not be an issue as they have a parking space withing their premises. If you cant stand crowd, you should avoid visiting it during festivals as the queue gets long.",1
"This is a Beautiful place and an Excellent Temple in a picturesque location. After the Darshanam of all the Gods have the prasadam at the Temple. Also varieties of tasty food stuff is available inside the Temple.
There is a star Hotel at the back of the temple ""HEIGHER TASTE"" One has to eat there.This is the only hotel attached to the Temple where on can taste the excellent food. One cannot make out the food is prepared without GARLIC. Keep some time on the morning to have Darshanam and classic Lunch.",1
All the Paintings inside the temple represents a historical things. A very calm place to spend time with family & friends.,1
"Teaches young and old to abide by a common Que for all. Care for the aged and physically challenged provided. Food court and gifts centre is an added entertainment apart from the light and sound show, which is at par of world class Quality. Good parking arrangements too.",1
"Peaceful
A tad too far...only accessible during weekends for people staying closer to South Bangalore.
Not so comfortable with the mix of business and worship!!
Atmosphere is silent and calm. Very soothing experience.",1
Sunday evening time with parents.. reversing time parents taking me to temple.. me taking them now to new age temple.. divinity,1
i visited tis place 3 hour i chanting there hare krishna hare rama.its a peace full place ant the radha krishna temple view is aswame.must visit this place,1
"Disappointed... In stead of divinity I found business ambience... Until I reach to the main Temple, there was just shops shops and shops... Selling books, selling pics,selling foods, selling God.... And a long corridor with huge unmanaged crowd. Even in main Temple, no one allows you to pray the God, but there also they try to sell one or another thing... I rather say this place as a shop or business house rather then Temple...",1
"Really nice, peaceful, clean and great temple! A must see if you love ISCKON Radha Krishna temples. Go for the evening Aarti!",0
"very clean and silent place, better you go by Metro then you get both experiences, food is available so no need to carry, best for friends, families with teens...",1
Very good place to find peace. Very good atmosphere and clean place. And specifically i love the people murmuring hara rama hara Krishna sound a amazing sound come to ear,1
"We were there to attend a wedding reception at one of the halls. The entire complex was beautifully maintained, neat & organised.

There were people going for the darshan, queuing up. In another area about 200+ people were listening to a discourse, and there was some hare Krishna chanting that could be heard throughout the complex, but it wasn't intrusive, but nice & melodious.

We thought of having darshan after the reception, but it was late & the temple had closed :(

Would definitely go to have darshan, and the attached restaurant is supposed to be amazing for sattvic food lovers!",0
Try to attend the aarti there. Very beautiful and clean place. Try some delicious sweets there. A lot of shopping options are present as well,1
"We stayed at Vivanta by Taj. This temple is about 4 kms away from the hotel. Took a cab. Easy accessible. Number of stairs to ride before you reach sanctorum. It is a great mesmirising temple with well decorated Lord Krishna, Radha, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda and other dieties. Singing and chanting was a great experience and delightful. Wish had more time to sit. Palki ceremony before closure of the daily chores, was another great experience.",0
"Organised, clean and not expensive r300 entry. It is quite a process to buy a ticket, get a shoe storage token, hand bags in and navigate the complex system of barriers though!

The temple gives a great view of the surrounding area and is busy and interesting. It is rather a 'commercial' experience though, with pressure to sign up to direct debit donations and buy books, toys and food. Apparently it is only a decade or two old, where I was more expecting a more historical building when I first went there!",0
"Pretty much a large version of a typical Hindu temple. If you're the praying type, you might like it, if not, go elsewhere.",1
"Well maintained temple with organised parking, food, queue, darshan. Best time is to reach by aarti time to enjoy the religious hyms.",1
The followers of this sect get pleasure and peace of mind by continuous recital of Hare Krishan Hare Krishan Krishan Krishan Hare Hare & Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare. They donot any useless rituals to be followed. They have developed these temples into neat and clean places of worship and all merchandise of need in the temple are available. A state of art canteen serves the visitors with neat and clean eatables on nominal payment. A good place to visit.,1
"best place to get serenity and inner peace in d busy life of bangalore.
love the prasad there.
i felt like staying there for hours together.....",0
"the place is one of the best iskcon temple is have visited. very clamn and scerene
the temple is slightly on uphill which makes it more magnificient",1
Like any other ISKON temple this is also maintained very well. The special attraction is Lord Venkateswara temple and Narasimha Swamy Temples also here. View from the temple is good.,1
Beautiful temple. One of the famous tourist places in Bangalore. Nearest to Yeswantpur railway station and Bangalore International airport but should preferably visited during a two-day trip keeping rush hours in mind. Advisable to buy tickets for faster darshan.,1
This is a place where your mind get relaxed and peaceful. The paintings displayed there will speak a lot,1
This is a temple of Peace and worship. Best time to go is in the afternoon. But you may face huge crowd. Better to go with family or friends. Don't bye laddu prasadam at the 1st exit as it is costlier. Once you go towards exit or 1st floor you will find same laddu prasadam at cheaper price. Don't forget to have prasad and roam around beside the holy pond.,1
"Most temples are a big business now, and this one must be one of the leaders! It is a very large, modern, attractive development about half an hour drive from city center. It is not disabled friendly. It is huge, beautiful and pretends to be a normal Hindu worshiping temple. But here it is all about money, how much are you prepared to donate and that decides how close you can get to your gods and worship! It is all about colour, glamour and rituals. How can one not be attracted to it.",1
"Typical traditional place giving a pleasant feel. A must place to visit in Bangalore. Well built , the Indian sculptures are all amazing.",1
"Built on the top of a hill, ISKCON becomes much more attractive in the day time with sunlight reflections. The paintings and the culture followed is nice.",1
"Not just the place of worship, it is one of the most visiting place of Bengaluru.. Located in the easily approachable location of Rajajinagar from Kempegowda Bus Station and other areas of the City.. Good satvik food for body and mind is available...",1
"One of the must visit place if you are in Bangalore!
The evening aarti and prasad is absolute bliss,u can't dare to miss that..those climes and chants will move any soul singing""Hare rama,hare krishna..krishna krishna..hare hare.. "" :)
Go and experience a pure Bliss :)
and do meet any of the prabhu's they'll help you with whatsoever difficulty you have!",1
"We were a family of 7, 3 kids accompanied by 4 adults. We went to majestic bus junction and took a bus to ISKCON near rajaji nagar. It is around a half a km from the bus stop. The temple is Calm, serene, very clean and tidy. You will find all hare Rama hare krishna devotees chanting mantras all over. Very spiritual and pure, a place to find yourself and dwell into devotion for Lord Krishna. The prasadam served there was too yummy. We visited the place during the deepotsavam - diya lighting event. We bought a diya for Rs.10/- each and lighted them.
Though I'm not a follower of spirituality, i found the place mystical and worth a visit.
The security is too high, we need to submit our bags and baggage/camera/laptop etc at the counter. Photography not allowed inside the temple premises. Visitors need to follow the traditional dress code.",1
"A must visit temple..The original simple temple design started in 1990 was estimated to cost Rs.10 crore gave way to a more stunning, unique architectural model that cost Rs.32 crores. The construction started in 1990. 600 skilled craftsmen spent more than 10 million man-hours to construct this architectural wonder. 32,000 cubic meters of stone, 131,250 tons of cement and 1,900 tons of steel were used in the construction. Subsequently the temple construction was completed in 1997.
The temple and cultural complex was inaugurated by the then President Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma on May 31, 1997.",1
"There were 3 temples in the campus.
Huge space.
Tasty prasadam.
Parking: available.
Photography not allowed.
We attended aarti there it was good.

A religious place which is very different from the rest of the temples in the city. I personally love the wall paintings in the main hall. The food they serve at the food court is really good especially the sweets and the south Indian preparations.,1

"We were a family of 7, 3 kids accompanied by 4 adults. We went to majestic bus junction and took a bus to ISKCON near rajaji nagar. It is around a half a km from the bus stop. The temple is Calm, serene, very clean and tidy. You will find all hare Rama hare krishna devotees chanting mantras all over. Very spiritual and pure, a place to find yourself and dwell into devotion for Lord Krishna. The prasadam served there was too yummy. We visited the place during the deepotsavam - diya lighting event. We bought a diya for Rs.10/- each and lighted them.
Though I'm not a follower of spirituality, i found the place mystical and worth a visit.
The security is too high, we need to submit our bags and baggage/camera/laptop etc at the counter. Photography not allowed inside the temple premises. Visitors need to follow the traditional dress code.",0
"A must visit temple..The original simple temple design started in 1990 was estimated to cost Rs.10 crore gave way to a more stunning, unique architectural model that cost Rs.32 crores. The construction started in 1990. 600 skilled craftsmen spent more than 10 million man-hours to construct this architectural wonder. 32,000 cubic meters of stone, 131,250 tons of cement and 1,900 tons of steel were used in the construction. Subsequently the temple construction was completed in 1997.

You will only enjoy these if you are a spiritual person with some liking towards goodies, foods, books, etc... we purchased a life wellness book just for Rs. 20/- named IQ, EQ, SQ... I recommend this medium sized book to you as this explains the essence and morality of the world and our life in this world. Almost for all problems in life you could find some solutions in some ways from this book. This is not generally sold in the books section; when you return after seeing the God to the downstairs, near the ramp, a man or woman will be sitting. You have to ask them specifically for this book. There will not be any displays. Hope you get that. Enjoy you time...... :)",1
Peaceful place to visit and you will enjoy the beauty so i will suggest everybody to visit here nothing much,1
The temple has some power which just lifts your spirit even if you are tired and exhausted. Visit and feel the power.,1
This temple is a modern and Majestic temple build by ISKON on a small hillock called Krishna Hills. It has got a mixture of borth south Indian and North Indian culture.. But You get peace when you enter this temple. At the same time some ISON dvotees are chasing us for donations for their various schemes.,1
This is the perfect example of weatherization our culture.. in short how you can sell god in a mall.. I used to visit lot of places in world.. here I will take an example of universal studio Singapore.. you visit any show in universal world where once show is over then they will direct you to another room where you can purchase toys and other items based on those show themes. In ISKCON also I feel more than god there business empire built around it.. not against building like this but I am not used to see place or worship and business area together.. it worth one time visit ...,1
"I have been visited 3 times , and feel again n again to visit this place , those are coming to Bangalore for any reason should visit this temple.",1
The place is Spirtually enlightened. Although there is always crowd but still you feel calm an serene inside the temple.,0
"I have visited this temple at least 5 times along with visiters comming to my place as I stay in Bangalore. All the time when I visited the temple was crowded. You can find peace and tranquility inside the temple especially if you search for it
the place is managed very well. Every time I go there I felt that this place is run a bit commercial. God does not need money. God bestows love and kindness to all, it permeate into each and everything in the Universe. This is left to each persons perception. However you will have a good experience of the visit to this temple",1
"Temple is located at Heart of City, good arrangement for Darshan in discipline manner.
When i reached finally at main temple , this was amazing & inner voice force me to stay more time at temple.

You must buy some inventory available for sale ( Books/ Pandel), before exit not forget to take awesome Prasad .",1
If you believe in spirituality .. This place is ideal for you. one must visit if have time while you are in Bangalore.,0

"i went there once with one of my friend and trust me till the time i stayed in Bangalore for over 2 years, i used to visit this place once in every 3 months... amazing place for finding that peace and relaxation away from a busy metro life... loved to be here.. :)",1
The temple is neat and clean and less crowded. Good place to visit with the family though the whole temple looks a bit commercialised,1
"I've visited this place on quite a few occassions. It is ideal however to go on a weekday when the crowds could be less and you can take your time to move around the tempe. Do go through the 108 chanting steps in your first visit, it gives you that spiritual feel. Also a nice visit for international visitors to bangalore to get a feel of our temples.
The religious and spiritual book collection is extensive at their stores.
Do try their free lunch for the devotees, it is simple yet so satvik and fulfilling.
They also have counters where you can buy various snacks and eats, all vegetarian.",1
definitely not for south indian devotees...seeing this temple you will not have the feeling of being inside an temple since the entire architecture and their attitude makes you feel as you are inside an mall for shopping...they just try to milk your money as much they can,1
"It's different. It's not the architecture that amazes people - its modern. Don't expect an ashram like atmosphere, its nearly in the middle of the city and can become quite populous. If you have been to south Indian temples (I have been to hundreds of them), you'll notice the difference in culture (or rather methods) of prayer and construction. This is unlike other temples around. It's worth a visit if you haven't been to an ISKON before.",1
"This is not a temple by any standard...its a business institution. Sure it is clean with a nice ambience....those things are also available in decent hotels. Everything in there looks fake to the T. The exit area is a shopping mall. If you want glitz and glamour in a temple in the form of huge deity idols and mechanized dances then this is a sure place. Most people go there to eat free prasads, to enjoy the ambience and walk around like in a shopping mall.",1

Temples are really the treasure of India and I felt like this temple is one of the best. I could reconnect with my Divine !,1
"Went to ISKCON with friends first time long back and was awed by their construction and maintenance. Most of it all the music ,decoration and beauty if the idols in this temple leaves you spell bound every time. It had good parking space and good food options too. As we went early in Sunday morning not much crowd was there.",1
"It was really an amazing experience my uncle visited this place and told me not to miss diwali celebration of this temple. I went on diwali nigth. It was amazing experience with excellent cracker show and prayers beautiful decoration and temple...
felling religious.
Don't miss it.",1
"Its better to visit in the early morning or late evenings as you do get parking space inside the temple. If there happens to be a long queue and you have a kid, your request will be well entertained.",1
"This isnt much of a spiritual temple as much it is a commercial hub, but the view of the main hall is totally worth it in the end. The beautiful mandapa with those astounding idols and the breathtaking view of the hall and paintings on the ceiling do make it worth the long lines and numerous stairs. A must visit place with family specially if you have people who love temples and all. Do not worry about the stairs as for elder people they provide an auto service at the gate which will directly drop them off at the doors of the main temple. I wouldn't recommend buying any souvenirs from there as everything is fairly overpriced at the stalls inside the temple. You can get almost everything for a lot cheaper price inside the city or around shops in that area.",1
"This temple has started a noble program to feed under privileged children who used to drop out of the school at a very young age. The attraction of a hot, hygienic and taste mid day meal has made thousands and thousands of children to come back to school. This method of serving the society not only took care of malnutrition but also basic education to the most needy.
Apart from the social cause, the night pooja should not be missed to see the glory of divinity. It will take out all stress, anxiety and negative thoughts from mind even if witnessed once. If your are believer of Lord Krishna and have not visited don't miss out.",1
Modern Temple and quiet place to spend time in solitude.Several steps to climb. Souveniers to purchase. Nice restaurant at the exit.,1
"I have visited the temple quite a lot of times. Sometimes with friend/s, and at times with family and every time I found it worth place if u desire for a nice, peaceful, relaxing and involving kinda a place. In the evening its even more nice to be there coz of the large open space and since its situated on a little heights. It is a good option if you are religious and also good one if you are not religious as such. The idols of God and the entire architecture inside the main temple is said to be made out of gold. And there are many stalls also inside after darshan. You can either purchase some thing for your dear ones or you can also have some paid snacks. The vendor side can't be said as bad but then nothing too special for eatables they sell and the rates they charge. And the end of it,.. as always prasadh is really good and tasty.",1
"Its a place to get good spiritual experience.
Normally ISKCON is known for its Akshaya Patra program. Where thousands of School Children are fed. They have a very big automised kitchen which is very clean and hygenic. Temple Complex is quite huge.
What we liked more is the Abhisheka Seva on every Friday for Lord Srinivasa and every Saturday for Prahallad Nrisimha. It happens around 05.20 am and lasts for 20-25 minutes. Its a paid Seva limited to 5-6 couples and their family of 4 members. As it is performed very early in the morning members can book accommodation at the Guest House at a reasonable rate. GH is very spacious and can accommodate 6 members in bigger rooms. We have 2 and 3 bed rooms also,
We have participated in this Seva on 4 occasions.
The main event days are -- Annual Brahmotsava, Vaikunta Ekadashi and Kartik Deepotsava.",1
"This is a busy temple and usually crowded, however attending the aarti or the kirtaan gives a sense of inner peace and tranquil. The food one can buy here is excellent (vegetarian without onion and garlic with egg free desserts)!",1
One of the attraction in bangaloe The propel who Devotes of lord krishan Must visiting place with in 7 Am in the morning afterwords its like pick nick Spots The Main Radha Krishnal and shrinivas temples are very attractive ands whiching in the early morning is very nice if you fell we are in the enchanting moments of Lord Shri Krishana,1
A worthwhile place to visit with family. The temple is well planned and ambience is very pleasant The place is neat and tidy. It's better to avoid rush hours otherwise it will take a very long time to complete. The location is well situated and its easily accessible now as there is a metro station nearby. It's worth a visit...,0
"While they do take donations, the temple is free and quite beautiful inside. They feed countless school children every day as well with a network of trucks. After the temple tour, you have to walk the gauntlet of commercial sales of religious nick knacks and sweets, however there is a short cut out for frequent visitors and there is no high pressure sales here. The restaurant called Higher Taste next to the temple is pure veg and quite good ( tried a la carte menu but they also have a buffet).",0
We went to Bangalore Iskcon with my husbands parents. It was quite a spiritual experience. The campus is very serene and clean. There is also a place to eat and have refreshments. Members of Iskcon also have accommodation facility inside the campus.,0
"It's hard to review a religious structure especially when you're not of that religion. So I can only say that- it was much bigger and cleaner than any other Hindu temples I have been to. If you want to be treated like VIP, just be ready to shell out more for the entrance fees. I was surprised there was such a thing. Those who are able to pay more get the best seats in the temple. You'll be guaranteed a seat in front of those who paid less than you did.",1
"Definately a must see but no photos allowed so you can't share with friends, but culturally A must. Probably the most spectacular temple in Bangalore if is located in a very built up area close to one of the main shopping districts.",0
A beautiful temple. Very nicely built and kept clean. The greenery around is also well maintained. A must visit for all.,1
Very nice temple - Must visit for the built and architecture of the place - Also very good place for fresh food on the food court of temple - will recommend the place if you are in Bangalore.,1
"I visited this place with my friends. We came as a gang of around 8 people and it was our first outing in bangalore. Since we dint plan for any major outing on the day, we decided to visit ISKCON to spend the day. This place is more of a commercial spot than Spiritual. Of Course, this place is great for those who are in for spirituality. But for all the others who just want to spend a day with friends or family with affordable good food this place is ideal. The temple has huge halls decidated for commercial establishments... As you tour across the building you will find food items at low cast and some beautiful art pieces as well. So, go on and enjoy your evening hangout with friends and families at this wonderful place with two advantages 1. Soak in Spirituality, 2. Also have a Commercial feel with the shops available there and nearby. 2 in 1 at one place.",1
"Week ends& public holidays are pretty crowded.not to worry.good crowd control; order maintened throughout.you can have Darshan at Lord narasimha's temple; then Tirupathi balaji&finally radha /Krishna. Clean,well maintained premises.after Darshan,one can shop for religious books/souvenirs&other gift items. Lots of eateries selling snacks on the way out.definitely worth a visit.",1
"Discipline at every step makes this temple unique from others. They make you chant the krishna mantra which you will start repeating it without your consciousness and I guess thats when you feel the Krishna Consciousness.
Cleanliness is seen every where in the temple which takes it close to godliness.
The view of god from the big doors makes you feel the darshan realistic and decoration of the idol is beyond words.

Avoid visiting on holidays and festivals and plan to visit in the evening so that you can see it when it lights up to make the experience more beautiful.",1
The ISCON temple located in West of chord road is nice place. it offer spiritual expirience and knowldge. The temple architecture is leasing and ambience is good. The food is tasty and healthy.,1
Best place to catch up the peace of mind. Its brings a holiness to life and and art of loving people.,1
Been here 2-3 times with family and friends . Good place to have some peaceful spiritual time . Must visit for visitors who are coming for few days to bangalore,1
"Not a 'traditional' indian temple. But great place to spend some religious/spiritual time.
They tried to achieve the international standard on most of the amenities. The book stall has got a limited but good collection of books (regional languages also). Good shopping place, food court and cinemas.",0
"A local colleague brought us to the temple. Upon arrival purchasing the entrance tickets we were told shorts were not allowed. Thankfully they have a solution for that. At security you can get your 'skirt' on for a minor deposit fee. It is kept very clean, which is nice considering you will be barefooted.
Go with flow, you will get a very good treatment, be carefully of pickpocketing.
At the end, enjoy the market, the food, and you will have enjoyed another Incredible India moment.",1
"The temple is situated up a flight of stairs and is terraced. You can drive up to a certain point and park. I am not sure if two wheelers are allowed in. I have been here by public transport.
The interior is beautiful and you can sit in the temple for a long time and contemplate. The feeling of being in a spiritual place can be felt here.
As you exit the main temple and walk down you will see several shops with gifts and sweets. On some occasions, you will also be invited for lunch as part of some celebrations. The lunch is free, though.",1
One of the best location and also great place to stay and amazing deities to take Darshan. Must visit if one goes to Bangalore,1
I stayed two days in iISKCON temple. Morning pooja is very good and night closing bajana's is very good.,1
"A must visit place in Bengaluru. Located near Rajajinagar, this place is pristine and spectacular. A must visit for all spiritual and non spirituals!",1
"This is place we visit quite often with our parents. The big lure is the ability to connect with our spiritual side using Lord Krishna's tales and teaching. Most people chant his name 'Hare Krishna Hare Rama Krishna Krishna Hare Hare' to build their concentration on the present and the glory of the place. If one is lucky to visit during evening one can be part of the Arti as well. The grandeur of the temple is that it overlooks a hill and is away from the humdrum. The peace and tranquility is a welcome break.

The ladoos and the sweets inside the temple complex are good too. The free prasad at the exit is usually a very tasty dish of either khichdi or a sweet deal which round off the good experience. The parking is always full and one needs to be resourceful to find a vacant spot. However, the temple security are helpful.

If one can brave the yeshwantpur traffic to reach here I would say this place is a good pilgrimage spot within the city limits.",1
"Temple is very clean. They promote ISKCON. Lot of free space. Children can enjoy. When you come after darshan there are lot of stalls which gives food, little costly but very good quality.",1
"wow this is beautiful big temple, we went there and it was rainy, as it is marble floor you need to be careful getting if it is wet floor, there was lot of bhajans going on inside and on the way out there were lot of gift shops and yummy food for sale.",1
"It's in mid of the city (so not like the hundreds of years old temples in far away scenic serene place)..neat and clean.. crowd well managed (yes yes, they have a VIP line for quicker entry if you pay the extra fees, and i do not like it: i like the temple where every one is equal)..rich temple with gold plated areas.. then while exiting have to come through the small selling mall.. but i must thank for the free prasad (khichidi) they served to all at exit.. tasty and eatable and well arranged..",1
"It's always interesting to see religious sites. To a foreigner who has never experienced a Krishna temple before, it is quite different. I was not allowed to bring my camera in (gave it to my driver), and I had to take my shoes off early on -- so I walked in socks quite a distance. There were aisles for lines, and the lines were quite long to get in (afternoon), but I was early so I was near the front. There was also a sort of special lane (fast pass), where some got to go first. I was surprised to see that a couple of people at the front of this special lane took photos, as did another person in my line with a smartphone. Meanwhile, there was a loud Krishna chant played over and over that enhanced the experience. It was interesting to see the pujaris (priests) in the temples, and the religious d√©cor was fascinating. As I started the long walk down the hallways to the exit, I was surprised to see numerous long tables with many items (books, etc) for sale, as well as an entire room full of food items. Finally, make sure you remember where you dropped your shoes off.",1
Temples should not be under rated. Never! But the mall kind of structure that they have created inside makes it look more like a commercial complex than a temple.,1
The Bangalore ISKCON is a beautiful temple located in Rajajinagar. The ambiance inside is nice and peaceful although large groups of unruly people visiting this temple may sometimes make it chaotic. Visit this temple around the evening for a soothing experience.,1
Do visit this temple if going to Bengaluru for trip. Nice architecture with peaceful environment and prayers going on to make this place more live. True devotees must visit to gain religious values.,1
"want peace,.,, just visit this shrine & relax for a while... Join bajans, great relief & peace of mind you can attain. Traffic is high as always but must visit",1
"We visited the temple during afternoon time and was less crowded. The Bangalore ISKON temple is huge and very well maintained. This temple was inaugurated by Late Shankar Dayal Sharma, the former president of India. Main features of the temple include gold-plated flag post and gold plated kalash shikara. The main hall where the deities are placed is nicely designed. The environment inside the temple is peaceful and noted devotees including foreigners singing Hare Krishna Hare Rama. There is no entry fee except nominal charges at shoe stand. The exit from the main temple is through a series of shops that sell books on Sri Krishna in several Indian languages and several merchandise as well.

"We were not informed that we could enter the premises with our car from a different entrance so my mother had a difficult time climbing the never ending steps through security, shoe collection etc. The whole visit has been made so clinical that the spirituality is lost !",1
"This temple is beautifully built.but whenever you go , you need to go through long que as this place is too famous.
You can buy prasad and some god idols, pendants etc for your near and dear ones.Must visit.",1
ISKCON had always fascinated visitors with a fusion of modern and traditional flavors in their temples and this is no exception. A well-maintained temple that will certainly enthuse people obsessed with cleanliness as most Hindu temples are not as clean and tidy as an ISKCON temple.,1
"This was a nice experience for me to visit this place, this is a most to visit in Bangalore but also you can find ISKCON templetes along India.

The place is good but it is too modernize, but at least is agood place to visit and know about this religion, lunch is provided for free there (it is included on the entrance payment)

You can also get nice souvenirs and religious things there",1
"Temple is excellently built up with idols of deities situated in the step manner. Also the ambiance inside the temple is relaxing and soothing. There are various options available with regards to pooja, darshan, aarti etc with various prices. Also it houses one of the best restaurants of the city i.e. Govindas and along with that it provides various options to shop as well.",1
"It's absolutely worth the visit if you are in Bangalore. It is a tad ""commercial"" -- bazaar, etc at the end -- but it is a beautiful place.",1
"The temple is just too good. The breeze that flows into the main temple makes it a great experience. There is also a bookstall inside the temple where they sell religious books, hotels are also there but a bit costly, I felt. Over alll, a great place to visit",0
"Very Nice Temple on the Chord Road and run by ISKCON.
Well maintained and a nice place to visit
Food is good in the restaurant.",1
"Excellent International facilities provided But no feeling of Divineness, very mechanical way of Dancing and chanting, lapse of holiness and serenity is missing External lavish maintenance beauty is visible. BUt inner voice is not heard Two Halls are well maintained, Food is excellent and delicious but too commercial also.",1
"Its a beautiful place so is the idols. It was really hard for me to take my site off the idols as they were mesmerising and can make anyone feel that they are in an eternal life.

However hard to get the feeling of being in a temple. Never seen a place where they sell products into the temple, in and around the place where we pray.",1
Good place for Hindus to visit.It is Krishna's temple.Nice photogenic place.Management may create the stress by making you go through queue etc though its not so good but a good place visit especillay around evening.,1

Very peaceful place... I make it a point to visit this place during non rush days... The main hall is really superb... Commercial place is optional.. But good to visit if you like something to buy...,1
"Hare Rama-Hare Rama- Rama Rama Hare hare... Hare Krishna hare Krishna ... Krishna Krishna hare hare...... this is the tune that keeps ringing in your mind. There are various temples in step wise ... The various avartar of Lord Vishna.. like Balaji, ram and Krishna and brother Balram, Radha Krishna idols placed in the temple. But once you finish with temple as you exit there are so many shops under the tomb of the temple that sells everything from flowers to food. The temple has free lunch prasad from 12:00 pm to 2 : pm.",1
"Beautiful temple like other Iskcon temples across.. has rush since this is in top 5 places to visit in Bengaluru.. however, I have other even more beautiful temple like that in mumbai.",1
"It has the Pleasent feeling of being in a temple,although it was in prime area still they was so godliness.Chanting n Bhajans are very spiritual...",1
"We went there two days before on Navratri ashtami. Not aware of its height and so much zig zag lines even for shoes . And that's for that morning when there was not a single person to visit.no rush no people. There can be short cut way to enter the temple when there is no one , like in airports when there is rush on a particular day they stretch the lines in a zigzag long way .but when there is no rush they cut short. We are senior citizens and heart patients but not the security told us ,not any sign of lift there.we were so much exhausted in climbing three floors height long long paths .after reaching so much height we asked some one there about any other way to go down then he told yes there is a lift there. We were very much surprised and felt bad of their carelessness for not thinking of devotees. These stairs and long paths should be used only on festivals. I request the management to take care of these comforts to public.",1
One of the finest architecture in town... You don't feel like a temple until you see the idols.. A temple with modern touch.,1
"Very nice temple. Number of things were admirable, but the siprit of actual service is negligible. That's my observance.",1
It was wonderfull to darshan radha mandir.i thought it might be similar to juhu temple but i was wrong.such a systemetic n no pandas were behind you,1
"I went there for the morning Darshan Worship at 7 am. It was very interesting to see all these people dancing and singing. I had never seen this kind of Worship and it was quite impressive!
The temple in itself is not as interesting as I thought. It is big but the architecture is not really spectacular, like in an ancient temple. After the ceremony which lasted about 20 minutes there was nothing more to do.
But it was free!",1
Really maintained well temple. Feel blessed by god after chanting more than 108 times God's Name. Will definitely visit againg.,1
Was great to be there for prayers. I really feel happy to see the way the temple management handle the situation during the buzy time. Devotees can have a great meditation moments here. Gift shops are plenty and offers best price for the items.,1

"When you are visiting a temple a thought on mind is devotion to god, but as soon as we see the exit which is where all the flea market feeling creeps in, to avoid that I had visited temple in the fist place, But this is more than a food street, I got confused if god was sitting at the right place.

Well its your wish what you think, no doubt the place is clean and holy, but again most of the devotees only visit for eating i suppose.

Well after that i thought did I just say
Hare Raam ..... or Hey Raam....
if you know what I mean....",0
"Visited the temple again after a very very long time and it was a major disappointment. Too commercialised now and has lost its charm. The idols itself within the temple, yes thats the ony charm to the place now.",1
"Want to reflect on many things but still want to have some good lunch after? Want to be in the company of God but buy some gifts for family on the way out? To top all that, want good parking options and cleanliness? ISKCON temple is the place to go!",1
"I enjoyes spending time in iskon, Since the bhajan will be too good, we will get peace of mind, Person willing peace of mind can go and hear the bhajan and enjoy",1
Visiting the place is really nice experience as this is magnificent temple. Separate entry for foreigners make it easier for people that are not visiting for praying.,0
An heaven on earth. One of a must-visit place in Bangalore. Has a well relaxed ambiance that anyone would crave. Hare krishna!,1
"This is a must visit temple if one is at Bangalore. It is in a central and convinient area for one to visit. There is ample parking space. Cameras,mobiles etc. are not allowed and need to be deposited at their counters. Chappals are also to be left in the stands. Lift facility is available for senior citizens. It has a que system and depending upon the crowd some times darshan may be little delayed. Very good ambience inside the temple. The main Deities are Sri Radha krishna,
Sri krishna Balaram. Besides Balaji and Narasimha swamy as also that of Anjaneya and Garuda are seen before entering into the main temple. All are quite beautiful. There is chanting of Hare Rama and hare krishna.
Temple timings as per the board displayed : 04.15 am to 1.00 pm and 04.30 pm to 08.30 pm
A good variety of food items are available in their cafetaria at a price on the returning path. Shopping mall is also there .
Free lunch prasad is served from 11.30 to 2.00 pm and one has to take tokens for this. Paid lunch at Rs.40/- is also available same time at their restaurant near parking area.",1
"Iskcon temple is a lovely place to visit, even with the crowds all around, standing in queue and passing by in the first queue in front of the God... the feeling is great and the aarti time is marvelous... you almost transition to a different sphere... After the temple visit, rest comes as a shopping complex, a lot many shops (will definitely some of the market streets of Bangalore) and even more eatery outlets, where you get all kind of snacks... Some are good like the ones with the paintings, artifacts depicting various Gods... Other than that... cleanliness is to be improved a bit in the crowded eatery areas (can't blame the temple staff as people from all walks of life visit the place)...",0
"I really loved the Temple. I went on a Sunday so it was really crowded, but it is really worth it. The inside is beautiful and the environment is incredible.
The only down side is that you can't take cameras inside. But I really doubt I'll be forgetting the experience.",1
"A spiritual visit up on hills.

Warning if you are going during noon, you might get foot burn after stacking your slipper outside the temple.

Recommend running up to the stairs as soon as possible.
It's quiet and you can connect to your inner soul.",0
"On my Banglore business trip after meeting i was at Iskcon temple. That temple built awesome all views from every point was make a new imagination. I recommend all my friends and relative to visit this temple.
HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA,
KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE,
HARE RAMA HARE RAMA,
RAMA RAMA HARE HARE.",1
"Visited with family in July 2015. The family consists of strong believers, not so 'strong' ones, moderately devout and pure touristas! ( as all families consist!) But all of us enjoyed the outing . There are elaborate arrangements for storage of your footwear and an ingenious system for washing the feet of the devotees as you walk in... The architectural marvel is right in the heart of the city. For the devout, there is definitely the ""presence"" the ambiance of the Supreme Being, amidst all the hustle and bustle of the crowd and the some-what un-subtle commercialization. If you are going because you are a firm devotee, please select a less crowded time like early mornings or afternoons, certainly not evenings in the week end.. There is a separate circuit for the believers, where you move from step to step chanting the prayer, which is moving and thought provoking, if you have the time. Don't get into that loop if you are there for a quick dekko and exit. There is a VIP darshan, which is not fair to the regular devotees, but alas, a fact of life. Also the commercialization could be made a bit more unobtrusive..... Otherwise we really soaked up the atmosphere and the magnificence and opulence of the deities. Please keep up the cleanliness and hygiene....Thanks",1
There were many pilgrims and we were advised to be careful of pick pockets. Like many tourists spots there seemed to be the never ending souvenir opportunities.,0
We visited this place on the night of Janmashtami. The atmosphere was electric and the temple was filled with devotees. The entire function was very well managed and it was a really refreshing experience overall.,1
"Aesthetically designed modern temple. Situated atop a hill, this provides a great view of the surrounding areas of Bangalore. You could witness the Akshay Patra Kitchen here, which is humongous in size and caters to the dietary needs of needy children across Bangalore. Unlike other temples, it has a fine dining vegetarian restaurant and many other facilities for visitors.",1
"temple with great view and reituls performing on daily basis
accomidation for members avilabale,food in diffrent levels with veriety in line of hygine and qulity",1
"Truly well managed temple with super luxurious vegetarian restaurant, superb guest house and ample parking space is a must visit for the tourists. Very good ambiance inside the temple. World Trade Centre, Orion Mall, Columbia Asia Hospital, Brigade Apartments, Phoenix West One and posh residential Malleshwaram Area is nearby.",1
"Iskon Temple have number of pujaris who worship the dieties according to vaishnava tradition. Iskon is popular by the name of Sri Sri Radha Parthasarathi Mandir devoted to Lord Krishna and Radharani.The museum inside the mandir is well equipped with complex modern technologhy spreading knowledge about vedic culture.The temple echoes the chanting of maha mantra ""Hare Ram, hare ram. ram ram,hare hare, Hare krishna ,hare krishna .Krishna krishna,hare hare "" leaving one mind,body and soul pure and tranquil.its a beautiful temple and a must see in the city",1
"Iskcon Bangalore is a beautiful temple, huge and really attractive. The atmosphere is very calm and gives a peace of mind. A must visit in sight seeing places if you're visiting Bangalore. It has a queue to reach the main temple though it doesn't take much time. The queue is organized and maintained really well. The idol of the main deity is beautiful and seems to provide an aura.",1
"Temple is structured, walk through it is organized. Good place to sit and ponder. Great eats in their cafeteria. One gets the feel that it is quite commercial, but, then they are trying to propagate their belief, I guess. It is for you to decide to join the bandwagon or not!",1
"We went on krishan janamshtmi
though it was rush there which was expected but everyone gping in queue. it looks good.
mandir was decorated veey nicely.
Must visit if you go to bangalore.",0
"I had being to this temple several times with family. You feel something different when you visit it. Avoid visiting during peak days as it may not give the feeling of calmness and space to view inside the temple.

Lot of parking space is available and do not park outside premises as it may towed area its kind a busy area since Yeshwant railway station is next to it. Also for shopping Orion mall is near by and if you have Metro wholesale card, is just next to the premises.

You have walk up to the main entrance and there are lots of small temples on the way up. For senior citizens and parents will small babies, there is lift available near the parking area which takes you to the main temple. You can ask to the parking staff about it.

Also good variety of food is available inside the premises which is always tasty :).

To reach ISKCON, should not be headache as anyone can take bus which is on the way to Yeshwantpur from any location of Bangalore city. Note, there are chances no direct buses are available and you can change buses from Majestic or Shivajinagar bus depot if required.

Must visit for people you wish to see in and around Bangalore.",1
"Interesting, a little crowded, but worth the time for a modern Hare Krishna experience, if you happen to be in this part of town. I'm not sure I'd go out of my way, but it's interesting and a good contrast to more historical venues you may visit.",0
Nice place to see but is very commercial. You could easily spend 3 hours at this temple. the ambience is good.,1
"This is one of the fantastic temple in Bangalore. So beautiful, mind blowing and awesome. I want say all the travelers if you are not visiting here means unsuccessful your trip.
So so good temple",1
"Though it is a spiritual place, it is more like a tourist spot and a shopping mall. Don't understand, this one is for devoting us to Lord Krishna or a business center.",0
"This temple is much different from the other ISKCON temples I have visited. This is a blend of South and regulat ISKCON architecture.
There are many Perumal sannidhis like in any South Indian temples.
But the main Radha Krishna- Chandra idols are like in other ISKCON temples.
There are too many shops inside the main temple.... One is forced to go through all of them.
But over all a great experience",1
"I'm told that Higher Taste, the Sattvic restaurant at Iskcon is hosting a Hare Krishna festival. This restaurant is a personal favourite. Come on, I'm sure you'll agree that the offerings are so innovative & that too within Sattvic standards.
Ok having said that, a warm pumpkin soup arrived at the table. My co-diner commented that Its smooth and flavorful. Agreed. Then a variety of appetizers awaited us. The best ones are the dal kachori, the fluffy casing has a nice moong dal mixture. Yummy I thought.
But actually I liked the mochar chop more. Can't help it. This is a popular Bengali banana flower snack, great taste & texture & of course, very nutritive.
Coming to main course, I saw that there was Shukto, another Bengali dish. Ok, Its made of lauki, so Its low cal.
Even as I wondered about this range of Bengali offerings, I was given to understand that that AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Iskcon's founder was a Bengali & this explains the presence of so many Bengali delicacies. I believe when Swami Prabhupada was in US, he served Indian food & in turn was treated to pizzas & things like that. Ah, I now understand how the festival has such diversity. Too much food, I thought.
No wonder there was gauranga potato, that's baked potato with herbs. But I must say the Shukto & the rich creamy paneer kalia are wonderful with Indian breads. Of course, diners also enjoyed the phul kopi roast, which is a nice marinated skewed cauliflower. South Indian staples like the Idiyappam aka String Hoppers with a subtle stew was lovely. The traditional lot stuck to the rasam rice.
Kids loved the live counter with papdi chaat and pani puri. Kids also relished the dessert counter. Soft cakes and a live counter serving malpua with thick rabdi are attractions. Malai ladoo is gorgeous, soft & somewhat creamy. I'm so used to a blueberry cake, but here I was surprised to find a blueberry halwa, so different from the regular suji halwa.
Thumbs up to this veg meal.

"It was my first visit to any ISKON temple and what impressed me is the maintenance and cleanliness. The constant chant of 'hare rama hare rama- rama rama hare hare, hare krishna hare krishna - krishna krishna hare hare' is something i experienced was first time. There are steps made in the queue for general entry and you are asked to repeat this chant on every step and then only move forward to the next step. I think this is a way to maintain the queue as the VIP Darshan people are not asked to chant. The inside of the temple is beautiful and peaceful. The exit is marred by shops selling food handicrafts etc. Thts not expected of any temple though..pure commercialization",1
The is on temple is the most important attraction in Bangalore. Located in the heart of city it plays a great role to tourists. The place is neat and clean and highly secure. You need to put chappals outside with no cameras. It is a big place with Lord Krishna in the center. Very well directed and well maintained. Should visit in Bangalore.,1

Its very cool inside and had a peaceful visit. Better to go in the morning. Nice to sit there for some time.,1
"It's one of the iconic spiritus place build in modern times . Well maintained .

Easily be the identity of Bangalore .

Too much commercialisation after darshan",0
The temple is awsome. We needed a wheel chair for my mother and it was readily available. The access was easy and darshan was good. Some of the smaller temples are not accessible by wheelchair. The exit route is via shopping area and food stalls. These are always packed and the place gets little messy. Ample parking available.,1
"The colossal temple, located on the Radha Krishna hill overlooking the Bangalore Metro and the city, is a serene place to go away from the din and bustle outside. Went to this place a few times, and the atmosphere instills a calm; there are ""aratis"" in the evening when lots of loud chanting and dhols are played with the ""purohits"" performing the arati. There are many idols of Radha and Krishna and a place for meditation.

There are some food stalls towards the exit, where one can get nice sweets at a reasonable price, which are healthy as well. I like this place very much, and go there whenever I need to spend some time with my soul.",1
"Its one of the biggest Krishna temple in Bangalore. There are 2 other temples Venkateshwara temple and Narasimha Temple inside the same premises.
The best thing one would enjoy is the Harinaam Dwar where devotees will chant the mantra Hare Rama Hare Krishna and will reach to the temple. Kids will enjoy the multiplex which hosts movies on Lord Krishna. Good eat out options available inside the temple, I personally liked the samosha. paid parking available inside temple premises. Cameras not allowed inside the temple.
The best time to visit the Deepotsav during Diwali festival.",1
"I went there in July 2015 and was totally mesmerized by the temple.
It's so much positive energy there.
Idols of Lord Krishna are worth giving a look and you feel spiritually energised after spending some time here.",1
"We visited early in the morning to charge our energy. Its like morning walk start from shose off to enter temple and cross different levels to reach almighty..
Stay for long time in front of God finish your prayer sit for while and charge for day energy",1
This awesome temple of lord Radhe-krishna is situated near to yeshawantpur.The arrangements are awesome and reachable from the bangalore city via bmtc services.,0
The details of this temple are impressive. The ceilings inside are elaborate murals with idols made with such intricate detail. Beautiful and worth the visit.,1
"This temple gives you so much inner peace, the hare krishna, hare radhe chants, the beautiful pieces of art and the calmness one gets when one is sitting inside the temple.",1
"I had a nice darshan of Shri Radha-Krishna at the ISKON temple situated on a hill in Bangalore. The evening Aarti is a good sight with dancing devotees. However, it does get somewhat crowded on weekends. The also serve vegetarian thali lunch to visitors at the temple complex.",0
"It is an overcrowded place, it was my first visit just to know what it is like. It is a highly commercialized and crowded place now. Will not go to this place second time even though I have great regard for its founder Swami Prabhupada Ji
Its vegetarian food restaurants are OK",0
Nice commercialize complex with help of god half day can be spent here.hare rama hare ram ram ram hare hare hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare,1
the iskcon is famous krishna temple. and its is decorated very nicely. everyone has to visit this place once. its really nice place. the jaap of hare rama and hare krishna was adorable and touching.,1
This is no more a temple they have made it commercial outlet with cake shops and toys inside the mandir.,0
Awesome & must place to visit when you are banglore. Lord Krishna and inside ambience is just wow !!,1
"Must visit when you are in bangaluru. It closed between 12 to 4 pm, so visit accordingly. They have seprate line for VIP visitors for a nominal charge for fast visit.",1
This is the best temple in Bengaluru. Really nice infrastructure for this temple. Everything systematic inside the premises. We loved this place.,0
"So many temples visited during my trip but this one is so beautiful.
System to handel peoples is quite nice here.
Iskon shop is also quite good",1
A very well maintained place. I am a religious person and I went here with my family because I had heard so much about this place and it happened to be close to where we were staying.,1
ISKCON is one of the best place to start your day trip in Bangalore. Very good ambiance and bliss. Good administration and neat & clean. Good restaurants and good facilities. Dont forget to enjoy the Sweet Boli made here. You can have a bot of shopping as well. Laddu prasadam is also a must.,0
"ISCKON temple by its name has always been a tranquil place with beautiful idols of Lord Krishna and serene ambiance. Living upto its name, ISCKON Bangalore is a fully divine place to be. You can spend hours sitting there watching the architecture and decor or you can also delight yourself with delectable delicacies they have towards the exit part of the temple ranging from Gujarati khaman to kulfi and jalebi etc, that too at a very cheap price. They also have a handicraft centre with pretty things to buy and also a store with religious books, CDs etc at a very nominal cost. I would love to visit here during a grand Puja/Bhakti event.",1
"‚ÄúExcellent place‚Äù

You should visit this place if you visit Bangalore. Its located near metro. This place is nice.The top interior is very nice. Prasadam kichadi nice.so many shops on the way inside the temple for business concept.Check the timings before going. Well maintained temple. ladoo is very nice.",0
"I used to love to go to the ISKCON Delhi as a kid but my first and definitely the only experience of ISKCON Bangalore was terrible.
It looked more like a big market than a temple. This is not something you expect when you go for some peace of mind. seeing everything so commercialized made me feel like being used in the name of temple.",0
"A very well maintained place.

I am not a religious person at all and I went here with my family because I had heard so much about this place and it happened to be close to where we were staying and we had a whole day with nothing else to do and so we decided to give this place a try.

And I'm glad that I did.

After a few minutes in this place something started bothering me, something that was not quite what you would expect in a temple and I couldn't put my finger on it.

And then it hit me!

This place is CLEAN! And no SMELL!! No beggars at the entrance!!!

The cleanliness is something that you do not associate with temples usually. There, I have said it. Sad, but true. Let us face the truth....temples are not very clean because you usually see rotting fruits, coconuts and flowers being thrown around and temples usually have a peculiar but unique smell (like our railway stations. You can smell a railway station before you reach it).

ISKCON is squeaky clean and only has a pleasant smell. That is a big plus in my book.

There is a constant, repetitive, droning chant going on over the discreetly placed public address system. You can not escape it. It follows you everywhere like Mary's little lamb. If you like such things, you'll find it quite peaceful and divine. For me it got old in a hurry and started driving me a little crazy after an hour or so.

Well, that's just my opinion. You may find the droning voice quite soothing.

They have a big area selling some nice posters, statuettes, lovely T shirts and other trinkets.

There is a big walk-around restaurant where they sell very good, tasty meal for a very reasonable price. This place was not that clean but I think you should blame it on the people who visit and not the management. Even though there are many dustbins some people were dumping their plates where they stood and not in the bins.

But I think we will learn to keep our public places clean very soon. Like in a million years. I mean, what is the big hurry?

As you leave, they give you prasadam which is quite tasty. They give it in a disposable cup and again our people just eat and dump those cups all over the place except in the dustbins.

Only these two areas are not so clean (even though the employees/volunteers keep picking up the discarded food plates).

Give this place a try.

You will need at least 2-3 hours inside.

Srikanth H R",1
Shree Krishna Temple created and managed by ISKCON group. Very peaceful and devotional place. While returning from main temple you may fell you are in a plaza. As they make you to go through small market.,1
A good place to visit for sight seeing. Be aware that you have to be a barefoot to get into the temple. The higher priced ticket is worth it. Just get the middle one. Unless you are interested to get to know more about the Krishna.with videos and songs package.,1
"Its a beautiful place..Inside the temple there are 2 types of queues i.e ordinary and expensive..If you are not ready to wait some time in the queue,you can go for second one..You need to pay some money for that and you can directly go inside the temple..
Inside the temple there are counters for spiritual books,toys etc..Also you wll get snacks at reasonable price..Free Prasada is also available..Photography is prohibited inside the temple..But you will get some good snaps from outside..If you have bags or something,you need to keep it in the respective counters..They will charge some money for that.",1
highly recommended temple in Bengaluru. very neat and clean place. it is very refreshing place in Bengaluru.,0
I visited the temple around 15 years back and after that I was fortunate enough to visit in aug 2015. Visited the temple with my sister. The locality around has changed tremendously but the temple remains the same. I have heard that the mornings and evenings rituals are a spiritual experience.,1
"Iscon temples throughout the world are must visit temples.
Mediate and feel peace and get lost in Radha Krishan.
I only dislike one thingh that these places have become eateries also.",1
"Like any ISKCON center, this is clean and peaceful. One can find a quiet corner and rest awhile. Nice when singing is happening",1
A nice and quiet place for followers of Lord Krishna. There is a free lunch prasadam for devotees otherwise there is a basic restaurant and a hotel next to the temple.,1
The top of the hill attraction is what makes this temple different from other temples in and around the area. Especially the night aarti and the way it involves everybody is very interesting.,0
this is a place where people can pray without fear. it is a place where you listen to voice of good and also enjoy the place in very different manner.,1
It is a decent place to visit. But will not vouch for the quality of the crowd. All staff are very courteous and alll willing to help. Awesome prasadam! ! Very good and well maintained ambience and sanctity. Again visiting crowd does not follow the rules stipulated. Nice statues of deities. Very nice pooja.,1
"I visited the temple with my parents.They liked it.The inner architecture ,paintings are impressive. We had to stand in queue for the darshan.3 stages are there for darshan.Before entering temple we had to remove shoes.They have foodstalls inside.Only problem is you have climb up and down many stairs.In final stage there is place to sit and watch Radha Krishna idols",1
Ambience was good but people focus on selling and collecting money. I felt as if I m in some local market where people are shouting mam take this book this is for this much take this dress take this CD etc,1
ISKCON temple is situated in Yashwanthpur and is around 10 kms from the heart of the city. This calm temple offers you a great atmosphere to experience divinity.,1
"Sri Radha Krishna Temple ( Kannada - ‡≤∂‡≥ç‡≤∞‡≥Ä ‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤ß‡≤æ ‡≤ï‡≥É‡≤∑‡≥ç‡≤£ ‡≤Æ‡≤Ç‡≤¶‡≤ø‡≤∞ ) has deities of Radha and Krishna located at Rajajinagar, in North Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world.[3] The temple is a huge cultural complex that was inaugurated in 1997 by Shankar Dayal Sharma. The project was conceived and executed by Madhu Pandit Dasa following the wishes of HDG A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of ISKCON to promote Vedic culture and spiritual learning.",1
"The temple as such is beautiful, divine. We really didn't want to miss the temple having come to Bangalore on a short trip. Only thing about the way - too tough for aged people to climb. I took my mom who almost started panting mid way. Too many steps and too long a way to reach the main temple. They should cut short the way for senior citizens and people with disability. The cars can reach till up. But not everyone can afford a car ride.",1
"We enjoy a lot. Vary good temple , peaceful place to visit , good management , awesome place. I think their should be no charges to enter the temple. I saw three row one who pay 300 another 1000 or least one who pay nothing. Who pay more get more chanxe to go near to God",1
"Superb place in Bangalore you will get peace, beauty everything here.if you are going Bangalore you should visit",1
"ISKCON, Bangalore is very peaceful place to have good meditation. ISKON is clean Krishna Radha Temple, must every one see.",1
"one of the landmark of Bangalore the temple was constructed around 20 years back. The temple has 3 temples one dedicated to Lord Prahlada Narasimha, one to Sri Balaji , One to Lord Radha krishna, Sri Krishna Balaram and to Sri Nitai Gauranga. the temple is very well kept and the deity's are very well decorated.

If you get a chance one can also see the operation of the Akshaya patra kitchen which feeds 1.4 million children in India and operates mainly during the mornings. They also have the higher taste restaurant where one can have delicious prasadam. A must visit to one who visits bangalore city. Make some time so visit this place and if you request in advance a devotee can take you around .

The Akshaya patra is a very noble operation of iskcon Bangalore ande certainly needs our support.",0
"The Iskcon temple is located near to the Yeshwantpur station. It can be reached by any of the public transport local train, metro, bus. The place is very well maintained and clean. The inside ambience is amazing. The main temple is spectacular.
Pro TIPs:
* Go early in the morning if you want to see the aarti.
* Free Khichdi can be taken multiple times. Dont feel shy to ask. They do not say NO :)
* Photography inside the main temple is not allowed so do not try to take picture, you may end up getting scolded by the priests who are normally very smiling :)",1
I visted Iskcon temple for 2 times in my banglore stay. It was pleasant experience and awesome location.,1

Make sure if you not in shorts or a dress which shows your legs if you are a lady, they have a dress code, if you happen to get their in a dress, they will loan you a skirt and stole. Ignore the pandas who ask for donations etc. Try out some food items at the end of the complex.",0
"Beautiful temple...in fact, one of the most beautiful ISKCON temples. Magnificent structure, rich stalls selling varied books, souvenirs etc...luxuriously spread prasadam area selling variety if Indian and Western prasad items.",0

They have great book and audio visual stuff as well to buy...",1
Best modern temple of the century..... When u enter we will feel peace and silent.... Its not only holy place but also a tourist attractive,1
Visited the temple on Sunday around 12:30 pm. Main hall was full of engraved structures and huge picture frames of Lord Krishna. Khichdi was really tasty. One advice- Check timings before planning.,1
Temple of modern spirituality! The restaurant behind (The Higher Taste) serves great vegetarian food! There's quite a lot of parking but can fill up quickly on auspicious days.,1
Excellent Shri Krishna Temple. I place must visit if you are staying in Bangalore. Very beautiful built and decorated.,1
"brilliant temple complex and serene space in the bustle of the city
must go devotional place and prasadam is amazing",1
The place force you to forget every thing and loosing yourself in spritual feelings. This place does not require any recommendation. It is a must visit place of bengluru,1
Very impressive temple and attracts large crowds which does means large queues. The day I went it was raining quite heavily so the floors were wet and very slippery (you have to leave your shoes at the entrance before going in) so you have to be very careful. Also make sure you are dressed appropriately although there is the option of renting items of clothing when you get there. When we got there we were told what the entry fee was and we were sold a ticket that looks like it was a ticket that allowed us to fast track through the temple (avoiding the queues). Whilst we were not intentionally looking for such a ticket it worked for us given it was raining. The main hall was very impressive with the gold ornaments and the gold ornaments were beautiful.,1
Very big and attractive temple situated on hill.near yashwantpur railway station.very peaceful place.,1
"I found this place very peaceful and beautifully constructed. The colors are very pleasant to eye and the idol of Lord krishna is a beauty, one should never miss to see.",1
"we are not used to with this kind of temple, which looks like a palace, it's so beautiful but also something missing.",0
I had very bad experience there where don't request but force you or try to be over smart in approaching you for donations/ pooja fee etc. Very sad !,1
Good temple to visit if you have the time. Large crowds so get there early in the day. Was great to see the services live. Beautiful,1
"This grand temple near to yashwantpur railway station is a must visit for all Shri Krishna devotees.
Even if you are an atheist you can visit this place for awesome vegetarian food within 100rs.",1
Neat clean and very peaceful filled with all the divine thoughts as you enter to the premises of the temple. Well managed and cooperative staff are always there to help you out with any problem that you might be facing. Food is also hygienic and you can get everything inside there.,1
"This is one place can well compete with Thirupathi for finding business in everything around devotion. But then, Thirupathi has a heritage and archaeological relevance. ISKCON doesn't even have that. Vast buildings of concrete and marble, this place is surrounded with Bose speakers that chant and hum ""Om"" for that mega serial ambiance and then you will find numerous priests trying to sell you moksha.",1
"Main purpose of the visit should be pray at the various temples within the premises. Membership allows you some benefits for admission and on birthdays. After darshan, visitors are made to pass thorough shopping arcade offering eatables and goods. All the eatables are prepared in the premises. Avoid weekends and festive occasions to avoid crowds. Has an amphitheater projecting films on devotion and the lord.",1
"The ISKCON Temple in the city of Bangalore is worth a visit for it's uniqueness. Visitors have to pass 2 different deities to pay respect before reaching Lord Krishna's abode at the highest level.
Every evening, around 6-7pm, a ceremony is performed, complete with chants to Krishna. Krishna in different forms is in an impressive huge gold pagoda like casing.

Attraction is free, but no shoes,sharp objects, camers or bags allowed inside.
Good to bring umbrella or raincoat as stairs to temple are in the open air",1
Very peaceful place located in north west of Bangalore. The temple is well maintained and there won't be too much of crowd which means that the place can be visited anytime without spending long hours in the Q. There are opening and closing timings everyday. So call them on their contact num. given in the website before visiting.,1
"I have been here on numerous occasions, compelled by my family who are the regular devotees here, this temple is indeed beautiful, Huge and certainly well done, however the biggest let down is that this is institution is a might commercial model, its always over crowded and it will take hours before you get to the sanctum. *** This is my personal opinion, *** i don't intent to hurt anyone's feeling. I write this though i am ardent devotee myself, the only thing that i cant connect to is where people pay and get the vip easy access / darshan, this is not something i can connect to. but that said, my salute to the cause of Akshaya patra, this is very well conducted.",1
"The best temple I have seen in the city. The moment you step in, your spiritual senses will be taken to a different level. The art and sculpture is spectacular. You'll find an inner peace just by being here.",1
"Excellent construction, amazing experience. Beautifully designed and able to handle huge crowds, nice very big hall so that pilgrims will not get tired while darshan.

Idols are very beautiful, and huge variety of food available after darshan.

Great visit..",1
"It is a peaceful and very clean temple one would see in India. The approach to the main temple is well organized with separate paths for up and down as the temple is located on a small hill top except at few areas where the path is too narrow and may not manage big crowds. On the way to main temple first comes the Srinivasa govinda and then Prahlada narashima sannadhis. The main temple have Srinitai gauranga, Srikrishna balarama and Sriradhakrishna chandra gods. After dharsan one would step down through a large number of stalls including bakeries, which I felt too many in numbers very close to the main temple and looked odd. Then next comes prasada (annadhanam) distribution. After which one can climb down to the temple exit. At least one hour or more than two hours in case of elders is required to cover this temple.",1
This is one of place where I get real peace of mind. A slow light music in all over the temple is as pure as one want to make their heart to be.,1
"Visiting the ISKON TEmple in Rajajinagar is of course a must for all the devotees of Lord Krishna - it is a showpiece of the Society for Krishna Consciousness.
But even if one is not a devotee this temple is worth a visit. The architecture is interesting, the temple is built at an elevation which can be reached by easily doable steps. There is sufficient parking, which is well handled by the security.
The place is clean and well maintained. I have visited the place on multiple occasions- on one occasion we were fortunate enough to meet one of the priests who showed us the living quarters of the students who study there.
The prayer hall is spacious and on most occasions there is enough space for one to sit in meditation or prayer, unlike in many other temples.
At the exit there are multiple stalls/ shops selling souvenirs and Prasadam. The whole experience of climbing to the temple, praying and visiting he shops makes it a family outing for many!
Inside the temple premises there is a lovely eatery called The Higher Taste serving sumptuous vegetarian fare - on the one occasion that I ate there , a Rajasthani food festival was on , which I thoroughly enjoyed.
Definitely worth a visit if you are in Bangalore",1
"A clean and well organized temple. Even though thousands throng the temple complex on week days and even more on festival days, atmosphere remains serene. Religious activities go on seamlessly with lines of devotees/visitors patiently awaiting their darshans or just able to bypass the throng and carry on to the next leg. A very long walk with some climbing involved. Not all places are wheel chair friendly. From what I could see there are lots of members/volunteers handling the action very efficiently entry till exit. They do serve some wholesome prasadam. Can buy religious artefacts, books, book Poojas, food, handicrafts and few touristy items.",1

"Nice temple to visit. The idol of Krishna, Radha and Gaurai made from pure Gold. There are various other small temples before we enter main temple.",1
This was a very interesting Hindu temple. You have to go barefoot though the temple so be aware of that ahead of time. They tried to convert us and once we figured it out we moved forward but overall very beautiful architecture and statues. There are about 5 shops you have to go though as the exit which is why I am giving it 3 stars.,1
"This temple is constructed on a hillock and has very nice surroundings. The temple construction is excellent and very nicely organised. The people are very courteous and you can spend hours in kirtan. The Prasad shops give you everything possible to eat right from conventional Indian sweets to cakes cookies, pizza etc all pure vegetarian. There is nice collection of books as well. Overalls great experience.
The Akshsy Patra is a wonder of the world and is managed by this temple trust kudos..",0

It has a foodcourt also with reasonable pricing to taste local food varieties to donut, pastries, etc. as well.",0
The Isckon Temple in Bangalore is a great place to be at on busy days. One id happy to see the power and devotion towards Sri Krishna in this part of India. Not not long ago there was serious disputes between various functions of this society. They all seem to have solved themselves. The temple is beautiful you made is very well managed. At such places one like a good crowd management and this temple just reflects that.,1
. MAINTENANCE SUPERB. Feel like you are in the hills. Peaceful atmosphere. Soothing feeling of mind. Beautiful architecutre. Lovely RADHA AND KRISHNA.,1
ISKCON temple is built in various stages with different diety on a hillock. It is very easy to approach as it in main road. The main temple they have beautifully decorated Idols of Krishna and Radha. It would require 1 hr for the visit.,1
Been to ISKON 3 years ago and it was an amazing experience. Took my friend there this July and he loved it too. Unfortunately it rained so much we didn't get the chance to experience to step by step mantra to enter the temple.but it was nice. A place I would visit again when I go to bangalore ...,0

"went there with my parent in january this year. A nice place to have peace of mind. Starts with a queue to hand the slippers. Pay 100 to get a bucket of puja samaghri. Get into the temple. You should try the steps way to get into the temple and on each step you have to chant the words written in the paper they give you. Sit inside for a while, collect prasad and while coming out you can have food, different decorating material, gods statues and clothes..",1
"Nice place to visit, specially with friends. However, the place should be avoided during weekends due to rush.",0
This temple is more commercial than divinity. The temple is meant for people to pray not to see the fancy aspect of god.,0
Beautiful temple with excellent architecture which is a mix of tradition and modern. The temple premises is large and well maintained. Inside the temple the ceiling is very high and has many paintings. There is a gallery where you can buy artefacts and paintings as well. The temple premises has a restaurant for decent vegetarian food. Its on top pf a hillock and the view is beautiful.,1

"The ISKCON temple in Rajaji Nagar area is a landmark dating back several decades. Although a prominent landmark, on top of a hillock, it is now overshadowed by high-rise apartments and malls in the vicinity.

The facility is well maintained and welcomes visitors and tourists alike.",1
Very serene place. Went multiple time. The food join satwa serving satwik vegeterian food (no onion garlic) was really nice.,0
The temple is pretty and peaceful. But the highlight of the trip was awesome food collection at the end of the tour which was cheap and tasted delicious.,0
"One of the most beautiful temples constructed by Iskcon. The Aarti in the evening is splendid, and helps you reconnect with the divine. I am saying this as a person who is not so religious, but I really like to visit the temple.",1
"Never visited any temples, but went with my friend for some work and it's very beautiful and massive construction makes u feel that it's beautiful, only problem to reach is with traffic m",1
"I like to visit Iskon Temple and in Bangalore I found, people are very simple and they don't make so much noise however if you visit any North Iskon, you can see people chanting in high pitch.

Anyways I like this place very much specially Prasadam.

It is crowded specially on Krishna Janmashtami.

Hare Krishna...",1
"iskcon Bangalore is one of the most beautiful temple sights in the world. It's built in such a huge form creating a perfect platform to pray and spend some solo members with one's self.

The main temple hall is so mesmerisingly peaceful with the enchanting music and extremely beautiful deities-Sri Radha Krishna

One who is religious, likes to spend some spiritual time should and must go this temple as the atmosphere speaks itself.

Weekends and festival days are extremely crowded . Would recommend to visit on weekdays early temple hours of opening time.",1
"This is very unique place of Bangalore.u loved to go there.get nicely designed, well maintained, must visit this place....",0
"Visiting hours are defined in this temple so go in the morning before 12 and in the evening after 4. Best time in the morning 8-10

Don't miss the centre atrium sit and spend atleast 15 minutes to admire the interiors

Do try their free Prashad, high quality hot food, need more varieties, you can always buy, one dis-appointing factor is while you are exiting you will a series of shoppers, who will compel you to buy things, where you will see the place more as a street market and less of divinity.",0
"Beautiful Temple one of the most beautiful once that I have seen, but highly commercialised, after you see the main deity, there is a whole queue full of stalls that try to tempt you into buying all sorts of things. I dont know if all ISKCON temples are like this or not but this one is. They seem to have a special queue for the ""Members"" of ISKCON, Not sure how that works.",1
"Paid parking - Check. Multiple restaurants/cafes - Check. Souvenir shops - Check. Theater - Check. People taking selfies - Check. Young couples cuddling - Check.

Somehow this was not my idea of getting spiritual vibe. But people flock to this place and like it - so I guess I am the odd person out.
My advice - if seeking temple architecture or spiritual experience - this place is not for you.
People are encouraged to buy ""paid darshan"" - but it is not required and most of the times - queue in ""free darshan"" is very small.

Good things - Food in restaurants beats quality and taste of most starred restaurants of Bangalore. They have wheelchair access (something unheard in most Bangalore), free (clean) bathrooms and most crowd is decent and well behaved.",1
Very nice place... It's a hit with tourist ... Very well maintained and clean place....a bit difficult for elders as you have to walk a little bit and then take steps...,1
ISKCON is A Hindu temple under hare rama Hare Krishna trust. The entire place is filled with rama krishna chants. On Weekends the place gets crowded. Archana tickets worth 300/- for six members will allow you to move in a vip queue which moves faster and you get to stand closer to the sanctum sanctorum. You wil get Prasadam after the small bhajna. Many Hindu holy books are available for sale. Also many sweets and other handicrafts are available for sale. Very pleasant way to spend two three hours.,1
"This is one of the grand temples in Bangalore. The setup, dresses,decoration and idols inside the temple are very pretty. But a shopping mall starts as soon as you leave the premise of main sanctum. They are selling anything and everything on the name of Krishna. Long queue on snacks counter generally. Some of the other interesting things available in handicraft shops. But still the best value for money artifacts are books. Specially the translation of Gita which is available in ISKON book stores.

Parking on weekend could be a challenge so reach to early to avoid traffic.",1
"Sri Radha Krishna Temple has deities of Radha and Krishna also Narasimma avathar, Lord Venkateshwara available. located at Rajajinagar, in North Bangalore. it is located on hill top. There is a shoe counter available. Temple is very nicely built, very well maintained. There are prashadams both free and to be purchased, at the basement you will find several shops of books, food, clothes and gods photos. There is parking available at Hill top, no problem for sr. citizen and others.",1
Excellent temple and must visit in Bangalore. Especially during festival times. Avoid during holidays. crowd can be frustrating.,1
"You will like the place because of 2 things, 1. cleanness and 2. Chanting of hare krishna hare rama.",1
"i am a muslim.but,i heard a lot about iskcon temple.so,i visited the temple.i found it a very peaceful place.my mind filled with heavenly peace when i visited the temple.",1

The darshan experience was very good",1

Temple is very nicely built, very well maintained. There are prashadams both free and priced, spiritual books for purchase. We sat at the main temple on hill to listening to music in front of beautiful and well decorated deities.",1
Good to go once for a visit else only on the days when special Poojas are planned. Check out the special pooja and if atall any kirtans....,1
"very clean temple, which also adds up as a shopping complex, food court and things. The idols are very beautiful! The 'prasadam' - dal rice, served at the end of your journey through the temple is very tasty! Overall a pleasant experience with spirituality!
Never forget to visit the Hanuman temple nearby!",1
"One thing about the place is the cleanliness. When other temples have grime, this temple is sparklingly clean. One more thing ISKCON does well is commercialize. They have a multi cuisine food joint in place and rates justify a fine dining facility, more than a temple.",1
I felt truly blessed visiting this temple. We had to chant all the way up the queue. The surrounding was also good. Later we went shopping around in the complex and picked sculpture of Lord Krishna.,1
"One of the must visit places in Bangalore. Very quiet and peaceful place. Also great for a quick bite!! I visited a couple of times just for the samosas and chats
available there. :)",1

"This Temple is managed by ISKCON. It is a very peaceful and calm place. There is a free normal darshan and paid special darshan. Opt for the paid special darshan and you dont have to stand in the long queue. For the amount you pay for the special darshan, you can choose their publications and you will get special prasad.

"Nice place to visit with family or friends,the area is vast and it comprises of three temples,main being the Radha-Krishna temple housing the main deity,among the other two temples one is dedicated to lord narasingha the incarnation of lord vishnu.
The main temple is beautifully decorated and one should not miss the evening aarati over there.",1
"beautiful place,very surprised for a first time.but very crowdy and have little time to pray.but they have done it such a way for prayers own security.",1
This was probably the best temple we visited on our trip. It's not a short visit but well worth the time and money. The actual temple is amazing and after there were stalls and food for purchase.,1

"A spiritual place where every mind seek enough peace of mind required to cherish. A big memorable monuments featuring our traditional & Devotional facets of Indian heritage and culture. People who visits this place will have all modes of information systems available where one could get Good books written by great people explaining about
Krishna tatva ( Be unattached but be united), people will be delighted with arrangement's done by management with very nominal donations for eatables and books. Simple its one of the south Indian temples to visit .",0
Located near orion mall n metro cash n carry..its a peaceful place dedicated to lord Krishna..Awesome if visited during Shri Krishna Janmasthami..,1
It was brilliantly constructed with excellent infrastructure. The place is awesome you can be very peaceful when you are leading a stressful busy life. Chanting around with the name of LORD KRISHNA allover the temple...:) :),1
"nice shrine..pleasant and soothing atmosphere..the entry ritual is a nice one..reading the scroll and stepping on the stones.very nice..the main temple is good.the variety of things to buy is more ..in the lower levels..then the food level..a lot of nice dishes and sweets available.
just find a place sit complete the food .use the garbage cans..
use ola for to and fro journey..
pictures inside are prohibited..but u can take pictures just after food near the small artificial pond.",1
Nice to place to visit for peaceful environment.Need to be present during the pooja time. Timing is from 4.15pm to 8.20 pm,1
One of the best ISKCON trust temples . I never had been to such recently man made architecture to offer prayer to lord ShriKrishna. The experience at worship place can't be described in words its worth experiencing at the place itself.,1
Its such a mesmerising experience at this temple. First thing as you gain entry into the temple there a long queue which is very well managed by putting up granite slabs just enough for one person to stand on. By design this mechanism eliminate people from falling on each other unlike in other temple where people literally packedup tight. The best part of this is the main hall where you see all the deities and the wonderful painting on the ceilings. After this starts you commercial journey where you feel in you like in a shopping mall.,1
"Go there if you are interested in buying Krishna branded products. They are using name of Krishna to brand their products and make money. You can find Krishna statues, Krishna branded t shirts, carry bags, laddus etc there.",1
One of the best and the most magnificent ISKCON temple I have seen till today. Would not suggest visiting this place during a festival as it becomes very commercial and crowded with lots of food shops inside the campus.,1
The temple is very clean and well organized. It is not like typical temple. It will have a more of a tourist atmosphere than a spiritual atmosphere. Overall a good experience.,1
"Really neat & clean temple, I must stay this will be biggest temple in India.
It took us 40min to take Darshan and then come out to food and book stall area, food were there very cheap and verities were more than 30 items.
Everything is well managed over there from entrance to exit, like parking, lane, counters etc.
Temple staff also very helpful they were guiding in well manner to move ahead.
Also they have free food (Prasadam) at last exit point.",1
"I would start by saying it is definitely a place to visit once when you travel to Bangalore. It is well maintained, clean and beautifully constructed in a nice location. Having said that, if you looking for spiritual experience, then you might have to tune your expectations. It is quite commercialized that takes away the spiritual feeling of a temple and becomes more like a picnic spot/mall. It has food court which offers you variety to choose from. Though commercialized, definitely worth visiting once.",1
"The whole experience of being here is good but the time taken to reach the shrine is thru the selling activity .,the devotion and the regimentation clash here . Once inside the shrine - the very glimpse of deities and the founder are enough to evoke the feelings of joy just bring there .. On The way out is also , thru the commercial,outlets selling food , books , curios and much more . Be careful how much Prasad you want in your hand .i could not eat the most of it.,There are no dust bins in sight . Wish there were less commercial part of it .",1
a big temple complex. good place for a time pass. some times a little bit crowdy especially in weekends and other holidays.,1
Go for peace and addend the evening aarti. Even some good camps are organized by temple admins. Good place to energized yourself after busy schedule. Must visit if you are in Bangalore.,0
"Its a good place, you get into religious mood hearing the chanting... But its chaotic when too much crowd and got to move up and down by stairs to pray at different levels.. Inside the main temple totally divine...
But I personally did'nt like temple employees asking for VIP darshans to pay... Or again pay for flowers etc offerrings... Though its visitors decision to pay or not... But still it just kills the religious feeling n praying with whole heart...
Also the way from main temple to outside gate... Is full of temple employees selling religious books n malas.... So the divine feeling diminishes and one just has to appreciate marketing team efforts to sell these products.

Rest all sorts of sathvik food is available there, as well as chats eatery.",1
"Being a Life member we are invited for special pujas on our Birthdays and Wedding Anniversary. every time we visit we get a divine feeling.
I have also attended special festivals like Vykunta Ekadashi and Janmastami. Even though millions visit on these occasions, the arrangements are superb and Prasad is distributed to all divotees",0
"Excellent experience on visiting this temple really I don,t want come out of this place fill with divine Lord Krishna, pooja and Arthi very closely seen .good place sit and worship , we get peace of mind and relax

As is with all ISKCON temples; this one is very well maintained and quite huge temple. Serene atmosphere,1
"good secinic view from ISKON bangeluru,well maintained & neat place,especially go in evening for beautiful view",1
"Its a nice & spacious place, and yet too commercialized. You have dedicated meditation hall and it gives each one their own space in being themself. But too many glittery elements to distract your view.
Personally i couldnt get ""Bhakthi (devotion)"" here but would love to visit this place frequently.",1
Isckon temple is a place to visit in bangalore and never miss it. Here ull find the peace n the vibration of god. U will never want leave this temple. The mantras here are always on n clean ur soul seriously..,1
"You can visit the temple, to see the architecture and all. its a marvel. Usually parking should not be a problem, esp on weekdays. But on weekends It can be a problem, esp whenever festivals are there. You might end up waiting for parking itself. There is a nominal fee for parking. The place can get very crowded during festival days. elders and people with health issues will find it difficult, as they will have to walk for sometime and will need to climb up some steps to get to the main temple.They do have some provision to reduce the number of steps, but cannot avoid that in entirety. The normal entrance is through a small room where you have 108 steps, and you chant ""Hare Rama hare Krishna krishna krishna hare hare"" as you make each step. The main temple have deities of Radha and Krishna. The sanctum sanctorum and deities are covered in gold.
There will be always people who will be performing bhajans with musical instruments and you can sit there for some time.

The place is highly commercialized, with lots of shops selling souvenirs, photos, vanity items etc...There are many eateries selling snacks and soft drinks.
there is a Jain restaurant outside which serves Jain friendly food. The temple gives prasadam (usually khichdi) to every devotee who visits. You can also buy laddoos and other sweets as Prasadm. In all, you can visit the place when you are in Bangalore, but remember about the crowd during festival timings. suggested to go on a weekday to avoid rush.",1
"I visit the temple regularly, not cause I am a man who believes in God... Just for the reason going there and spending time chanting hare Krishna hare RAM and see the 'bhakts' dancing and enjoying is so soothing. This place is my point to go for finding peace.",1
Temple is still under construction. Location is beautiful and the Narasimha idol which has been installed is marvellous!,0
If you are in Bangalore and wanted to see beautiful architecture. Iscon will be in your priority list. Prefer afternoon time rush is less.,1
"There are several temple in Bangalore, both small, big ancient. However ISKCON stands out as its a massive structure. Its maintained very neatly and the crowd is also managed well & systematically.
Once you are out of the main temple one would experience that its so commercialized. That brings down our spiritual state to rock bottom.
Otherwise its calm and relaxing. Also its handicap friendly.",1
"Temple is huge but still maintenance is superb. Large number of devotees comes on weekend and they do also have special programmes on weekends. Special arrangements of darshan for foreigner so that their experience should also be memorable. I enjoy going their and Orion mall near to this makes complete day outing
Visit one and you will become regular",0
One of a famous tourist spot in Bangalore. The temple is maintained neat and clean. They do have marriage halls.,1
"Nice temple to have mental piece, and great view of city.

Once you come out of the temple, you feel that entered into shopping zone, not in the temple.

But to spend the time with family is perfect place.",1
"It's a Very good Radhe Krishna Temple situated near to Yaswantpur (Bangalore) railway station. It is situated on the top of a hill with ample of car parking space. It took around 3 hours for Harinama Darshan & Main temple Darshan, Prasad and free lunch prasad. The best part of temple visit is recitation of Shree Rama mantra for 108 times in Harinama Darshan visit.",1
"I have visited Iskcon in June 2015 last week. Temple was so beautiful, peaceful and fully organized. Also stayed in Iskcon guest house which was very clean and nice.",1
with its huge and grand premisis the entire temple complex is beautifully done and the nchanting mantras all over will take you to the different world when you step inside the temple.,0
Has visited the temple quiet a few times now. It surely is one of the very good places to visit. The only problem which i found out that there is a variable treatment for people to let inside the temple. I thought that was not a good tactic for money making.,0
"I've visited the temple few times in past, with family, friends separately. The temple is very much organized in the manner the devotees are handled.
Right from the moment we enter the temple, to the time we leave the premises, the temple is very clean and you feel pleasant.
The first thing after we enter the temple, we can start with taking 108 steps while chanting ""Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare"". Some people choose to continue into the main temple complex without doing this. It is up to the devotee.
The temple complex is huge and you can sit and meditate after darshan. While coming out, we can see many shops selling souvenirs, food stalls etc. There is also a room on the way out, having photo gallery of different swamis of ISKCON.
On the way out, we can take prasadam, sit outside near water fountain.
Best time of the day to visit is evening.
All the while, we feel at peace",1
I visit here in this June.. Really awesome I surprised when I saw God Krishna statue..its really glad for my family we visit like dis temple..good taste of Prasad. Peaceful atmosphere.. I want to visit there 1nce,1
I have seen so many temples of ISCKON in India but this is one of the biggest i have ever seen . The one in Mumbai is considered to be the biggest one but this has extended bigger than that. It is a huge temple which is beautiful and a must visit place in Bangalore.,0
"Its beautiful. you cannot ignore that. At night, the charm increases to the next level. the priests coordinate the aarti, which looks beautiful. Well managed and clean temples.
the devotees are also disciplined.
I am not sure if its a okay, or a bad thing, but i felt the volunteers to be salespersons, with targets, who'd convince you anything to buy the inventory of Iskcon.
Even the exit is through the sales counters which look like a huge supermarket.

Rest, it was one of the MOST RELAXING EXPERIENCES. Even if you just sit and do nothing. will still act as a de-stresser, if you are a non believer.",1
It is maintained well and clean place. Connected well in terms of transport. Good 1/2 day weekend destination.,0
"Well maintained, Beautiful, great peace of mind if you visit. Well organized entrance to visit to exit process, cant miss anything without visiting the whole. Quiet crowded during krishnaasthami but decorated beautiful always. Evening arati was also nice. Books for sell are also available inside. after Having prasad, we can sit nearby the beautiful fountain.",1
Easily accessible on the special Bangalore Ac bus tour route. Large hall and people allow you your time. No typical Indian temple push and pull. Very attractively decorated deities and temple is constructed in style and class. The only flip is the pushy sales behavior of some staff for memorabilia,1
"Visited this temple during a business trip in Bangaluru and found it to be a very impressive temple. Not only regarding the construction and the way you have to climb your way higher and higher, but also due to the tranquillity found over there. Shoes need to be stored against a small fee and also if you carry bags and camera's this needs to be stored before you may enter the temple. Entrance is not free for tourists, but is worth to pay.
Ignore all stands after you've visited the temple as this is very touristic and to my opinion not worth to pay attention",1
I visited this temple in the month of june with my family.I love the temple atmosphere and the musical steps.All devotees are so cool and helpful and I highly recommend you all to visit this temple.,1
"As a new couple, we visited this place and had a very Good Darshan of Lord Sri Venkateswara Swamy, Prahlada Narasimha Swamy, Radha Krishna, Krishan Balram. It was very pleasant and peaceful. Everyone should visit this place at least once they come to Bangalore.",1
"This temple is very huge. It is spread over in wide area and lot of walking is involved.
It has number of small small temples all around.
It has parking also.
One must be careful to reach the temple only during open time since the Main Gates remain closed One just can not enter.
The laddoos available there are very tasty.",1
"A thoroughly insightful experience. Incredibly interesting from the very first steps. Would not hesitate to recommend anyone visiting this temple during their travels, as you will absolutely not regret it. I know traveling around India can sometimes mean going to a lot of temples, but I would encourage everyone to experience this one in particular.",0
"Was a splendid location to hang out with your friends. In the midst of the city, there lies the temple on top of a small hill. It looks majestic in its view. Morning and evening prayer of this temple is harmonious. It is a famous temple of 'Radha-Krishna'. There are many good shops down the lane for food. Vendors sell religious books like 'Bhagavad Gita', 'Mahabharata', 'Ramayana' etc",0
Bangalore can feel a bit too much if you are not used to the traffic and the people. Iskcon temple actually offers a whiff of fresh air. Its definitely not for those seeking fun and frolic.,1

This is a place where a mind gets peace and the devotion comes by its own. The idols are so beautiful that it looks like the gods are themselves on earth and standing to show their presence to you. The shops outside are full of things which look like to be a must take. The prasadam is tasty and you can also buy some of it from the shops,1
Good Place for Peace Mind,1

Peaceful place,1
"Visited the ISKCON temple for about 1,5 hours on Holi festival day 2015. Took one of the short-cut routes at 300 Rupees. Which included a 70 Rp book to be selected at the end of the tour. Also candy was handed to me by the monks, stating that this was for sharing with the poor kids outside the temple. A nice thought indeed!",1
"You must visit this temple for Peace of mind, relaxing your body and enjoy simple food Temple contains good organic shopping market below temple. Recommends to buy coconut oil.",1
We went to Bangalore Iskcon with my husbands parents. It was quite a spiritual experience. The campus is very serene and clean. There is also a place to eat and have refreshments. Members of Iskcon also have accommodation facility inside the campus.,1
"Clean and Beautiful place with Peace. Post darshan, we all directed towards IISC - one of the best collage campus.",1
It is very owesome place,1
I love this place,1
nice place,1
The Temple really provides for a greater understanding of the Hare Rama Hare Krishna following. Clean and orderlly,1
One has to visit whenever he or she is in Bangalore,1
"The architecture is what mesmerizes you. Even though its been more than 15yrs since it was built, the view from the top temple reminds me of the Bangalore then. A must visit if you are in Bangalore and trying to explore the city.",1
This is a must visit place and has some beautiful sculpture and architecture. This depicts the devotion of swami prabhupada and is serene and peaceful. You will be amazed to experience a sense of peace and calm.,1
Once will visit this temple u will peace inside you heart and mind. God sculptures are beautifully dressed. I like the step which is separted with bars before you enter in main temple. Best part is Their bhajan and moving of crowds from one step to other while chanting God's krishna name,1
"This temple known for its grand architecture and a vast area that too ituated in a hill in west bangalore is dedicated to Lord Krishna.Poojas are onducted daily as per sastras. Gokulashtami celebrations are conducted in a grand manner and millions of devotees throng the temple everyday. This is one of the most attractive tourist places, where you can spend more than a couple of hours. There are shops and restaurants where people can spend time not to speak of the various articles likeRudrakshas,idols, books and agarbathis on sale.",1
"Visited temple in September. Temple is very neatly maintained. Full marks to management. Except at the main hall rest of the temple is converted into retail space. We get a feeling of shopping mall/ food court. You get best of the quality food at nominal prices. Fast food to junk food you name them it is available. Balaji temple is very attractive and gives full satisfaction. Lakshmi Narasimha temple is also pleasant. Main hall with bhajans gives pure relaxation and coolness because of the height and Bangalore weather. Good devotional books,Pooja items, grocery, apparel, gift items,restaurants etc are main attractions. Last but not the least Prasadam at the end is so hot and delicious you feel like licking your fingers for long time.",1
"Okay place , nothing much to see here . If your parents are religious you can bring them here once.",0

"It was my first visit to any ISKON temple and what impressed me is the maintenance and cleanliness. The constant chant of 'hare rama hare rama- rama rama hare hare, hare krishna hare krishna - krishna krishna hare hare' is something i experienced was first time. There are steps made in the queue for general entry and you are asked to repeat this chant on every step and then only move forward to the next step. I think this is a way to maintain the queue as the VIP Darshan people are not asked to chant. The inside of the temple is beautiful and peaceful. The exit is marred by shops selling food handicrafts etc. Thts not expected of any temple though..pure commercialization http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r315501517-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
"I visited the Iskcon Bangalore Rajaji Nagar temple on 24 Dec 16. It is a very big temple. The moment you enter the temple premises you get enthralled by Hare Krishna Hare Ram Matra. Top most section has the Shri Krishna and Radha Mandir and lower section is commercial where devotees can buy various books, Iskcon calendar and other items. It also has lot of varieties of food items that you eat there or carry. Daily prasadam vitran is also done for devotees. Overall very good place to spend quality time with God and family.",1
Divinity in modern world,1
Management is really good....,1
Must Visit if you are in Bangalore. Visit during evening time (Aarti) you will feel totally different. Beautifully made.,1
"I am from Bangalore and I had been visiting this place more frequently since my childhood. It's more of tourist spot in bangalore, than holy place of LORD KRISHNA. You can spend good time with family & folks and good amount of shopping can done here with eateries in & around location. Nearby location called Hanumantha Nagar, there is Lord Hanuman temple with large idol of about 25 feet height.",1
"ISKCON Temple: It is one of the most popular temples, particularly of the recent past. It has a top quality management, which manages the temple on professional lines. On normal days you will find crowds entering through the main gates will be able to drive through almost till the main entrance to the temple. The temple is located over a hilly-land area of aprox 7-8 Acres, this was just another hill which was transformed into this amazing temple by the efforts of the temple committee. It incorporates a wonderful synthesis and fusion of traditional temple architecture with modern principles of construction and civil engineering. When you access the temple premises by foot, you will initially reach a footwear leaving place where you can deposit your footwear and walk further up to the actual temple environs. You will notice that most of the pathway is protected against rain and hot sun for those special days. You will soon be at the very entrance to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple where you will be faced with two options of going through the 108 rounded steps wherein you can enjoy the charm of reciting the Hare Krishna mahamantra on each step while waiting for the Queue to move forward, and this will be an enjoyable experience which is relished by many. Alternately, you can also by-pass this and use the other direct route, if you are short of time, wherein you can go to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple by the side route. When you enter the Sh. Laxmi Narasimha Swamy temple you will be struck by the awesome beauty and the amazing sculpture work of the main deity over here, you will want to stare at it to eternity and will be lost in spiritual ecstasy, however, life must move on and the crowds behind you would also want to have a glimpse of the Lord, and so they will usher you to the next temple. Do remember to pay your obeisance/worship to the Deities of Garudadeva and Shri. Hanuman on either side at the entrance of the Narasimha shrine. You will now be at the entrance of the Shri Srinivasa Govinda Temple where you will once again be mesmerized by the outstanding fineness and excellence of the sculpture work and you will feel as if you have been magically and suddenly tranlocated to Tirupati. After you enjoy the reverberations of Govinda, Govinda, you will now head to the main temple. The vast main hall on level 3 is accessed by wide steps with banisters and has a beautiful gold plated altar, with attractive interior designs and a ceiling with huge paintings, which are held together from the roof down, depicting the pastimes of Lord Krishna with His devotees. There is an all round internal balcony which gives a view of the temple sanctum sanctorum and this adds to the glamour and beauty of this place and also gives a birds eye view for the people during festivities when the crowds are spilling into the streets a kilometer or two long on occassions like Janmashtami etc. Everyday thousands of devotees from various parts of India and other countries visit the temple to seek the blessings of Their Lordships. At the main temple you will be bewitched by extraordinary beauty of The Presiding Deities in the temple Sri Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Krishna Balarama and Sri Nitai Gauranga (Sri Nityananda Prabhu and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu). After having prayed to their lordships to your hearts content, remember to offer your respects to the most beautiful bronze sculpture of Srila Prabhupada who is peacefully witness to all the goings on in the temple and who guides the same by his divine presence. You will also see the endless rows of books by Srila and other devotees which are available for sale. If possible one should take this opportunity to contribute towards a life membership of ISKCON which will also feed millions of children in schools through the Akshaya Patre (endless supply of food, originally given by Lord Surya the Sun God to Yudhishtira, the Pandava King) program. While you allow all these things to soak into your mind and body, get back to Planet Earth and head towards the exit you will find lots of shops and sales points where every type of devotional stuff and vegetable eatery is available to satiate your taste buds, do check them out if you are in a hurry to move to the next location on your itinerary, otherwise head straight to the Higher Taste Restaurant in the same premises to eat like the Kings & his courtiers, see review separately for The Higher Taste Restaurant.",1
"I have been a regular visitor to ISKCON Bangalore. It is a place for ultimate bliss. The deities are dressed so well, the sight is so enchanting, it is sure to leave you mesmerized. Make sure you sit for sometime in front of the deities and to consume prasadam, which is given free for everybody as you exit. A wide variety of books are available for purchase, many of them will leave to keep thinking. A variety of restaurants and food stalls are also available. Also do not forget to take home some sovenier as a memory. Visited October 2014",1

A must visit when in bengaluru ..the ISCKON temple is a beautiful Radh Krishna temple situated in between the city ....a visit in the evening is better ..with all the lights and fountains i is a beautiful sight .....the temple complex is huge ... and there is a shopping complex a theatre and museum .,1
Best veg food in Tastey. Serene environment on non festival days. Lively on Hindu festival days.,1

"Hare Rama hare Rama rama rama hare hare, Hare krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna hare hare.",1
"I went there for the morning Darshan Worship at 7 am. It was very interesting to see all these people dancing and singing. I had never seen this kind of Worship and it was quite impressive! The temple in itself is not as interesting as I thought. It is big but the architecture is not really spectacular, like in an ancient temple. After the ceremony which lasted about 20 minutes there was nothing more to do. But it was free! http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r320062759-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",0
Located in very busy area in Bangalore but still it attracts tourist at this temple. You can surely meditate and relax your mind after having hectic day in Bangalore traffic.,1
nice visit. although the never ending gift shops may put off people. but do try some of the foods at these shops. they are amazing,1
Temple has structured administration. Well maintained. I visited on a Sunday.Nice to see people dancing.Krishna consciousness.well maintained temple. Must visit place in Bangalore.,1
The ambiance is triply. The place is so energetic and positive.,1
It is a very good temple.it is clean and very beautiful.it is very disciplined the food is nice and delicious,1
This is divotional it's superb it's allways clean & g Greanary,1
Peace place,1
"I visited this in the morning. There is a secure place to keep your laptop or other important stuff. Place to keep your shoes etc. While entering temple, priests ask you to buy different kind of prasad or puja. After doing darshan, everybody is given prasad and langar.",1
"This place is huge and shows up the essence of Buddhism. You can go there and attend the mantra session and see everything inside the temple, includding a huge gold throne. There's parking and a place to buy souveniers. I recommend this place. Visited September 2013",1
"Temple is good peace of architecture. A way of saying modernization of Indian temples, But together with the moderniz?",1
Amazing Workmanship by Artisan..such a lovely place,1
"It does not feel like you are in the temple. It feels like, you are in commercial mall where they want to sell everything on the name of God. I recommend please visit Iskcon temple at Ahmadabad where you are not forced to go through pre-defined areas where they are selling stuffs on the name of God. All these amenities could be at certain side only for those who want to buy it.",0
Temple is peaceful place to sit and relax. There are some restrictions on attire you wear so make you follow them else there are alternate arrangements at the temple. prasad etc is also good. Worth a visit with parents.,1
This temple is in the other part of the Bangalore towards Yashwanthpur. Very close to Brigade Orion mall. The idols of Krishna and Radha are enchantic. You will not feel like going back from here.,1
You will get inner happiness & positive vibe,1
The place is good but its more of a commercial temple. The stairs are very high so the people with leg pain should not go.,0
"once visited iskcon temple, i feel very peace , nice place to take a break from daily hasty life . weekdays much more less crowded, weekend will be hectic.",1
"Really impressive, overlooking the whole city, but very modern and a bit too commercial. Still definitely worth a visit (remember that you'll have to climb the steps bare footed, so could be very slippery after rain)",1
Modern amenities used to spur up the spirituality,1
"One of the best coolest temple in Bangalore, I visited lots of time here. Beautiful view you can see from the top of temple, very silent and clean Lord Krishna temple.we can get free Prasad in temple. You can get fresh air in this temple.",1
"The ISKCON temple is beautiful and again a must visit. Spread over a vast area there is ample parking space and is quite well organised. The evening prayer and aarthi gives a sense of peace and is calming. There is also a community kitchen/ restaurant (not a restaurant in the real sense of the word) which serves various snacks and delicious typically South Indian delicacies. Everything is served in the name of ""Prasad''. A different and unique experience.",1
Was very nice to visit it......... Feeling very happy,1
"The tour guide , took us there it was centuries old , very Interesting . The Architecture of the building was the most interesting to us.",1
Very nice & must be visited this place once at least. you can fine more peace at this ISCKON Sri Radha krishna-chandra temple. The shops were nice Quaity Food For sale .Not much crowded compare to other well known temples.,1
The temple is made on a hill and has a magnificent idol of Krishna and other Gods associated with him. A place where you can sit peacefully chanting Krishna's and Ram's name. Please don't indulge in the money related activities here.,1
"Iskcon Bangalore constructed in south indian style with white in color, deities are decorated very beautifully , calm place, the stalls are located below the temple structure not visible as in other places, the prasadam is very tasty?",1
It's very nice place,1
"ISKCON temple is very good, located in west of cord road, Rajajinagar, Bangalore. It in hill and the god Sri Krishna is very good. Please visit this place.",1
Probably best of all Iskcon. May be people who cant walk nuch need not visit this. But ya nice place to visit if you dont have any issues with your leg.,1
It is a very god temple.it is clean and very beautiful.it is very disciplined the food is nice and delicious,1
"Whether you are religious or not , a very good temple to visit, You would appreciate art, cleanliness and arrangements at the temple. And after temple food at stalls is really tasty.",1
"It's very pleasant place,had a focus workshop quite interesting and had some fun with my besties",1
"If you are on a path of Bhakthi, this is good place for your progress! Idols in this temple are very attractive and Place is very scenic. Live bhajans are going at the time of our visit.",1
"I visited the temple in January 2013. At first sight, you cannot but notice the strict security controls. The path to the temple is clearly through many steps and everything is commercialised. One has to perforce chant the Hare krishna mantra, even if one does not wish to, forced by the Hare Krishna monks, who thrust a card into your hands in one of the stations inside. There is a special darshan for people who can pay cash of Rs 500, which is atrocious. The entry to the temple is regulated at every point and it does not give a good feeling at all. Also, the eateries and the many shops within the temple fail to induce any religious fervour. I felt thoroughly disappointed with the whole experience and would never go back. The ISKCON temple in Juhu is more laid back and that experience is more suited to calming the senses.",0
"If you're like me, you've been vaguely aware of 'the' Hare Krishna followers in the West for many many years -- in their saffron robes, often distributing their literature at airports or other venues. A visit to ISKCON may answer many questions about the religion -- and it is a beautiful, amazing building. Personally, I prefer the older traditional temples around Bangalore -- but this is a place of great interest!",1
"I visited this temple in my recent trip to the city. I reached there early in morning and took 45 mins to complete the visit. The best part to do a jap of 'Hare Krishna and Hare Ram' 108 times before you enter the first temple. The temple is nicely built and properly maintained. The only downside (according to me) is bringing commercialization inside the temple, but that might be done to attract tourists and giving comfort to them. Visited August 2014",1
"If you go there , you will feel what exactly ''peace'' is !!! Hare Krishna !",1
Well I love this place cause I get to see my kanha ji with his beloved Radha ji. However highly disappointed as there s no facility for a challenged person to walk up so many steps to see the deity. There s no such facility for people who can't walk to go so far n climb so many steps just to see lord Krishn. Highly disappointed ?. I could not get my father cause of this reason,0
A modern structure with glass facade.I personally did not get a feeling of being in a temple. If you set aside thoughts how a temple should be you can visit the place like you would visit any place of interest.,0
This is most beautiful Vishnu temple sit on a hill. Bangalore Metro made easy to travel this temple from many parts. The city view is spectacular from the temple. One can enjoy beautiful sunset from here. Temple spreads pure devotional and knowledge to all.,1
Bangalore,1
sunil ram,1
"The temple is a lovely place to visit, the car parking is adjacent to the temple when you arrive there you are required to remove your shoes and place them in the shoe station for which you will be given a token, during the warmer weather the pleasing coolness of the matting which is placed around the surrounding areas is a very welcome thing as the floor does get very warm, the temple itself is stunning inside and all visitors are given a warm welcome the artwork inside the temple is just superb that is if you can tear yourself away from the stunning entrance, photography is allowed although in my opinion the best view is through your eyes as opposed to any form of photographic equipment, there is a small gift shop and a video presentation, wander in and around and let yourself be guided by the calming influence here and take just a small time for yourself to take in all the surrounding and to gather your thoughts would love to visit here again sometime.",1
"The temple looks good along with the arrangements and all the architecture stuff. But it's not a typical temple concept what we see in other places.. After you visit the place, you will feel like you went to a museum rather than a temple. A lot of money has been spent on the architecture and decorations. Still a good place to visit for once to get an experience of how things go around in temples like these.",0
No words to describe lord Krishna. It is wonderful and a legendary experience to visit Iskcon. Your time will pass en?,1
Hare Krishna.,1
Very good pleasant atmosphere,1
"Devine place. Must visit with elders in your family. Have car/bike parking place with decent price. One can see the idols right in front. Take a family entry ticket, with that you can see the gods right in front in all 5 temples.",1
"Probably the best temple i have ever visited, It was like visiting vrindavan in mathura, Audio chanting the names Hare Krishna and Hare Rama could be heared across the premises,excellent crowd management, and most of all excellent eating facilities inside the temple complex with almost no profit no loss rates.Must visit while in Bengaluru Visited July 2014",1
"Temple and maintenance is too good. Idols in the temple are beautiful. Can spend some time in the premises of temple for peace of mind. Many shops selling food, prasadam, pooja articles etc in ground floor of temple",1
"The place is quite neat and tidy, maintained well. very peaceful ambience. lot of parking space. would certainly love to visit whenever I go by that direction and wish to stop over.",1
"good spread, very good quality and can eat without 'fear'...great value for money, super ice cream and dessert... great place and super service",1
This is very pleasent temple in Banglore and every body must visit to this temple if he is visiting to Bangalore. Visited October 2014,1
It's a great place. Inside the temple it's very systematic. Just love it...,1
"I'm Happy of getting Feed to My Soul wen I chanting the Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare.... Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare....",1
"Hidden Truth: Once Lord Vishnu foresaw British rule, division of India and generation of crores and crores of refugees. He saw crores of Hindu Bangali of Bangladesh will lose everything and will take shelter in Nadia district of West Bengal and other parts of West Bengal and India and they will be landless, penniless and just like beggars. So, to appease those refugees he decided to take incarnation as sanyasi so that those poor refugees accept his path and become happy. So, all landless refugees will accept Vaishnavism dharma and in performing that dharma, refugees will feel themselves happy and satisfied because rituals, rules and regulations of this dharma will be similar to the condition of their life style. Thus, Lord Vishnu tried to solve refugee problem.God can foresee everything going to happen, so he could see arrival of Britishers in India, their rule, division of India, generation of refugee and fertile area for spreading of Vaishnav dharma. Mayapur was the fertile area because he knew that refugees will assemble around Mayapur area and refugees will be so poor that their life style will be similar to that of a Vaishnav.

Nice. Very peaceful,1
"This visit was a visit to the temple after about 12 years. a lot has changed, long lines of people, too much wait to get to the top. The main temple of lord krishna is now fully decorated with the yellow metal which is a stunning view that mesmerises the devotees. the ambience is truly wonderful and one gets dissolved in atmosphere inside. The gift shop and food stalls are now like a local market in the basement floors and is a place of total chaos! Visited August 2014",1
"A nice place for spirtuality , but soomuch shopping is thereee",1
"The Most Wonderful Place of Peace & True Emotions & Feelings in Life also Most Beautiful ISKCON Bangalore Temple in India, I Visited Twice by Now",1
The temple is very clean and well organized. It is not like typical temple. It will have a more of a tourist atmosphere than a spiritual atmosphere. Overall a good experience.,1
"Superb place in Bangalore you will get peace, beauty everything here.if you are going Bangalore you should visit",1
Being an avid devotee of Krishna my friend took me to this fantastic place. I loved the neat and tidy environment and the crowd was just amazing. I had good time there with my family and have some memories. We accessed the place easily through a carpeted road and I recommend it to all visitors!!! Visited March 2014,1
I got a bunch of blessings here and liked the food but there's something odd about the laddu. Very beautiful modern temple!,0
The temple arena is quirt big and has a lake. The main hall inside the temple is huge n marvelous. Be there during the evening aarti which looks great,1
Well maintained as you expect from Iskcon administration. Prasadam is good and tasty. You can also buy souvenirs for your family and friends.,1
This is the only temple of ISCON which is Blue in exterior in line to the color of Lord Krishna. This temple is modern type architecture and is situated on main road and very near to the road connecting city with the outer roads towards yashwantpur. There is good and clean facility of vegetarian eateries and parking facility within temple premises. Neat and clean temple stand out glowing in blur hue during night and is one of the most visited landmark in Bengaluru,1
It is good excellent temple in Bangalore,0
This is a great temple run by Westerners who are true believers in Hindu deity. It clean neat peaceful good place to mediate or just sit there,0
This is a very calm and quiet place. The campus is lush green. A very well organised place.,1
"Goloka Vrindavan in Bangalore! Nice deities of Radha and Krishna, nice place.",1
I had been to this temple many times and I liked this temple.Now they made this little commercial friendly which is little odd compared to other temples.,1
Bhavya very nice,0
"I would like to say , don't go there expecting spiritual experience, you will get a commercial one ...",0
Every one should visit this temple. 2)Going with family is nice 3)We find so many temples in at same place.,0
Hare Krishna....Well maintained temple premises.. peaceful atmosphere...,1
Especially the Arathi time is must to visit. ISKON's mid meal program is world famous. If possible schedule an appointment to see the kitchen. You will never regret this decision.,1
Enchanting,1
I felt very nice visiting the temple. The interiors are very beautiful and the overall feeling is very pristine,1
A nice place to visit with families. A serene and clean place. Had goid and sumptuous food. Plenty of varieties of food for connoisseurs.,1
Must visit. Don't leave bangalore without visiting this place.,1
peaceful place beautiful sewa of lord radha krishna balram and nitai gaur .,1
Awsome..,1
Srikrishna vasudevaya Namah,1
Had a lovely time discovering the Hara Krishna temple. People were very friendly and took time to explain,1
"Very peaceful, very connecting to Krishna. I simple love this temple. I generally go here and spend good time. It also has some very good eateries as you come out and afterall it is the Krishna Connect",1
"I love the place, very good indeed. you will find peace of mind. they have some food corner in there, where vegetarian food is too good.",1
It's okay..,0
"I went to Iskcon after a gap of almost 10 years, not sure how was the experience last time but this time it seems to be good. First thing first, they have ample parking so no need to worry - one has to somehow reach beating traffic in Bangalore. The way they have constructed four temples (one above the other) is a visual treat. The main temple has a lot of place to sit and enjoy the spiritual music. What follows after darshan is something many people may not like but I was fine. First, one has to necessarily go through all the spiritual / book stalls and then one will see a lot of food on sale. It is like a mall in my opinion. The only complain i have is the temple authorities should mention at the top itself the free food is served at the very end. What really happens is people get excited after looking at a lot of food options and they end up eating after which they have no appetite to enjoy the deliciously free meals. Overall we had good experience.",1
When i came to bangalore this is the first place which i visited and its worth comming. Very nice temple with simplicity. Have metro station nearby all transport accessible. And as all iscon temple it is also one of the classic temple.,1
"It is huge and takes a few hours to weave through it- especially because you have no choice but to become a participant in the experience. I am not religious, but I am spiritual and enjoyed participating. It was unique compared to the other temples I visited. I think everyone should visit this place. The things I didn't like: because you're basically in a single-file line the whole time, you can't really stand around and just soak everything in and appreciate the shrines and stuff. You gotta keep moving. The other thing that is a huge turn off, is it seems like a business- as soon as you make your way through and get to the big room at the top, they have floors of stalls and tables and people aggressively trying to sell you things. I did buy a CD of the chanting, and it is beautiful and was super cheap. But it was frustrating to be in such a beautiful temple and feel that the experience was tainted by the business-like approach to the people there. They have a restaurant downstairs, and it is clean and tasty. An interesting experience for sure.",1
ISKCON temple in bangalore is located in Rajajinagar. It is near to ORION Mall. Visit temple before 12 pm or after 4 pm as in between is the closing time. There will be complete rush in weekends so you will be waiting there in queues for darshan. Inside its a very huge temple with beautiful and magnificient architecture and interior. In the temple premises you can get pure veg food and refreshment at nominal rates.,1
"Worth a visit if you are in Bangalore. The temple is very clean and organised. If you are looking for some peace you can come here.. A little commercialized due to fee for special pooja and just after the darshan you will find a line of shops for food, pooja stuff etc. Don't visit for the market but for the Temple.. NO entry fee",1
"overly commercialize modern temple, when you make a donation you go into a ""special queue"" where you will be blessed by the high monks.",0
A Temple that you have to visit and experience the positivity! Its beautiful...The food served inside is also a must try!,1
"Visited lot of times ISKON, while visiting this place i feel peace in mind, there one theater available to see the videos of lord krishna. and finally will get lot of food items there to eat.",1
"People do come for darshan, but they have a great variations to have in cafeteria, i didnt like it imagine we get Pastries and Prasadam. Money Minded.",0
Really great place and the atmosphere here is really good.,1
Very peaceful. Each and every place and word existence of lord.,1
Really very clean atmosphere. Actually I didn't like temples but that place has touched my heart.,1
located in the middle of a busy area the temple is very calm and quite once we enter it is a really peaceful place to be one with god very refreshing the variety of snacks available inside is also good,1
"The temple is a wonderful experience for tourists and for other folks that would like celebrations of a very traditional, ethnic, original, and simple nature. The priests are very well-trained and well-'versed' (no pun intended). The food is strictly vegetarian and very tasty. The premises are very clean. The one MAJOR problem with the temple facility is that they're overly fussy about photography and do not allow even family events (such as weddings) to be photographed. I find that ridiculous, especially for such once-in-a-lifetime events of loved near-and-dear ones. Also, what harm could possibly occur when flash-less pictures are taken, of the temple and its premises?! The variety of goods that are available for sale in the temple is huge, and spectacular. Those are a bit overpriced, though, and not adequate discounts are given to customers that make purchases of many items at once. I recommend this place to anybody that is willing to have a nice experience despite some of the drawbacks that I have described above.",0
Iskcon Bangalore is a nice temple. Situated on a hill top. Very pleasant to spend time there. I have seen and enjoyed a lot.,1
Its a wonderful temple and it feels really peaceful inside. There are many stores in the temple from which you can buy devotional stuff as per ur choice.,1
excellent. definitely will be going again.a beautiful temple well kept and maintained professionally.you can peacefully pray here without any hindrance.highly recommended place to go,1
"We performed our daughter's wedding on June 6th & 7th, 2015 and i should say, it was not just awesome having it there?",1
Amazing experience.Very clean and peaceful environment. Well maintained and properly organised.,1
"If you want to feel the closeness to god, just visit this place. I have been there several times. I feel the calm and the purity. Awesome",1
"We had heard a lot about this temple, its structure, arrangements and puja and we had a long desire to visit this. When we visited this temple, we were amazed to see the well designed and laid out grand structure with a very disciplined and organized management of the visitors. Be it various puja places, prasad and souvenir shops, every place was worth visiting. We really were happy to undertake this visit which a memory to treasure !!",1
I got to visit this temple when am moving across Bangalore to Mysore....i found this temple to be one of the best temples that we have in the south region thus i say at a place where we get much peace and attract us towards godly path....!!!,1
The lord Sri Krishna and Balarama inside the temple was so eye feasting..!! The prasadam was so delicious..!! Food court was amazing in the temple..!!,1
It is a great place to see,1
Wonderful architecture and kirtans !!,1
Feels good,1
"Clean premises, friendly people and tasty food!",1
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare,1
Nice place to visit in Bangalore.,1
"Great Hindu temple at Bangalore, it's good place clean",1
Very clean and very well managed. Charges for PRASADAM is also reasonable.,1
Every Sunday i went and i m so happy and i loved the way they are doing chanting and kirtan. i stay always till the Palki darshan and Arti.,1
"For people who love to appreciate architecture , like to search for their soul is the right place . But the think I strongly disliked campaigning Indian Lord in Tiffin Box , Pencil Box etc . If we have build a huge temple for lord then why in cloths , cricket bat . bedsheet etc . Felt like Krishna Mall .",1
Hari boll jai radha Raman ki jai ho bless with ur love and care,1
"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Situated on Shri Krishna Hill in Yeswantpur the main ISKCON among st all temples is a must visit place in Bangalore (This is the numero uno place to visit as per Trip Advisor). The first shrine on the way up the hill is Narasimhar, followed by Srinivasa Govinda and finally Krishna-Balarama, Radha-Krishna & Nitai Gori at the top. One can take special passes on crowded days which helps to beat the crowd apart from performing special poojas and gifts as books / photos. The temple opens at 04:15 and closes at 12:30 in the morning & opens at 16:00 and closes at 21:00 in the evening. You may also want to contribute to their record breaking midday meal scheme Akshaya Patra at Rs.950/- per child for an entire year Hare Krishna!!!",1
"The temple is beautifully constructed with magnificent interiors embellished with embossed gold surfaces. Its kept spic and span and the priests are also very nice and they are easy to talk to. My six year old son had questions about the golden interior work which they happily answered. Its little away from the main city so the travel time plus the visit there would require approx. 4 hours. they do have a canteen there where one can eat. the temple premises also has a restaurant with lunch buffet and Ala-crate options. Though, I feel it was overly priced at 750 per person since its on the temple premises and claims to offer Satvik food. Isckon Temple is one place I would definitely take my parents when they visit. the atmosphere is very peaceful and serene. I would have given it 5 points, however, there is one thing I kind of disliked is the packages they share for offering to God. the rate card is a put off. But, it may be good for transparency sake and they definitely need donations for maintaining the property well.",1
Nice and peaceful place to visit near yeashwanthpur. You can get lunch also there for free. Must visit once.,1
must visit atleast one time if you are in bangalore. It gets crowded especially on festivals and you may have to wait in long queue.,0
It is a good place for vaishnavas...But the suggestion kiosk outside the temple seem to be not under care. I have submitted a suggestion and I did not get any reply.,1
Visited in April 2016 and had very good darshan and excellent time,1
Amazing experience.,1
"Its a beautiful place so is the idols. It was really hard for me to take my site off the idols as they were mesmerising and can make anyone feel that they are in an eternal life. However hard to get the feeling of being in a temple. Never seen a place where they sell products into the temple, in and around the place where we pray. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r321828655-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",0
Huge temple complex... At peace.. You can visit multiple times.. For sure...lord krishna is mesmerizing.. If you can go towards the lunch time.. You will get good prasadams..,1
It's great experience,1
"Iskcon Bangalore is one of the best destination in town. And better than one Iskcon temple located in Tirupati. The temple is having a great commercial area where you can buy so much of stuffs including food, beverages, clothes, trendy items which is having Krishna themes, Antique shop, devotional books etc etc. Try to visit and spend some time to listening their Bhajans as well.Visited November 2014",1
Hare Krishna Whenever I go to the temple I get a sort of enjoyment and then they even arrange some cultural program,1
Good place to spend weekend Historic,1
A Mesmerizing experience. A must visit for everyone.,1

"ISKON Temple situated in Mahalakshmi Layout off West of Chord Road, Bangalore has become one of the most sought after tourist attractions in Bangalore after the legendary Lalbagh and Cubbon Park gardens. The beauty of this temple is that it offers entry to persons of all religions and faiths",1
Well maintained atmosphere with discipline. Good place for a holy visit,1
"I went on a weekday evening. So luckily i did not get the crowd although the place can really be packed. Walk along the path chanting Hare Rama Hare Krishna, its that peaceful feeling. The sanctum sanctora is a lot of gold and glitz and is a sight to watch if you are ok with the idea of bling in a temple. The eatery below serves delicious food especially sweets cooked in ghee. Make sure you get to watch the sunset over the hills. Its a great sight.",1
The crowd that they maintain during Krishna janmastami or vikuntekadershi u may feel like its going to take 2-3 hrs f...,1
Really nice and good temple,1
"More than lord krishna, i could remember only pav bhajji, samosa center, shopping centers,etc.. i would say they should stop commercializing iskcon temple. I dont recommend for people to go if they are planning for peace of mind, just go if you are planning for any shopping and eating",0
"Very bad experience, we traveled from Europe to India and visited iskcon temple, had a very pleasant site for a glan...",0

It's a wonderful and fantastic place for spiritual divine blessings of Lord Krishna. Every body should visit ISKCON at Bangalore. We get the peace of mind and forget all our problems. Hare Krishna Hare Rama.,1
Journey from mandir Entrance till Divya Darshan of Radha Krishna and Aarathi. especially in the late Evening is full of Bhakhti and Love Showered all Over.,1
I visited this temple in the month of june with my family.I love the temple atmosphere and the musical steps.All devotees are so cool and helpful and I highly recommend you all to visit this temple.,1
The temple adorns a beautiful idol of Lord Krishna - Radha and also a huge prayer hall. I would like the place better if they had a separate place to sell food and other products as it makes the place look very commercialized.,0
ISKCON has created a chain of wonderful temples all over the world and this one in Bangalore should be one of the grandest. The quality of Puja is extraordinary and the crowds are genuine devotees. A great experience,1
Loving the place so much Peace,1
Lovely place!! Must go once with family or friends,1

Leave your mind and only carry your heart ~ rest is all your experience. Worth a visit. Sit in silence as long as you can and watch the vigrahas > you experience calmness.,1
"The ISKCON temple is an amazing experience if you want to emerge into the HARE-KRISHAN culture. I am from Brasil and the cultural impact it was great. The temple offers an insight of the religion along with beautiful architectural details. It's a must see. Be firm with beggars,",1
"A neat, peaceful, well maintained temple. It has 3 levels with the main deity being Lord Krishna with Radha. It was decently crowded but I could find more crowd for the shops there. Lot of varieties of food was present. We enjoyed tge samosas there. Many stalls were put up but a lot of them were a little overpriced but that was understandable considering the maintenance cost of the place. Overall, a good place and is a must visit at Bangalore.",1
Its really a nice temple to visit and spend time in.. really enjoyed the times I visited there and easily accessible through the bus and now the metro,1
"This temple is constructed on a hillock and has very nice surroundings. The temple construction is excellent and very nicely organised. The people are very courteous and you can spend hours in kirtan. The Prasad shops give you everything possible to eat right from conventional Indian sweets to cakes cookies, pizza etc all pure vegetarian. There is nice collection of books as well. Overalls great experience. The Akshsy Patra is a wonder of the world and is managed by this temple trust kudos.. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r301854694-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
This temple is the best place to relax your mind and eat some food and if u don't have money they'll provide a tasty prasad best prasad i have ever tasted :),1
The iskon temple is one of its kind. You never get tired also after waiting for so long in the queue for the Darshan. The Prasadam is so delicious and hyginic. Can sit there for hours and chant Hare Rama Hare Krisha .,1
Nice temple,1
Sairam I love the TEMPLE until we have the DARSHAN of GOD wonderful atmosphere chanting 108 times in each step I love...,1
"It 's true, it is a modern building and clean. They even wash the feet before entering. To enter you have to pass by two metal detectors and then check the backpacks and want to know what's inside. The route is obligated both to the faithful (followers) and visitors, so you are in a space made of 108 panels, each of which you must recite their mantra. and then you enter the large and magnificient room with the vault decorated. And 'beautiful to see, too bad the photos are strictly prohibited. Then begin an endless series of rooms on three floors, where they sell everything, including food. A junk of kitsch objects, both colorful and very young sellers, and cooks, and waiters and gardeners, and controllari, all senzaltro volunteers ... Ok, well we work voluntarily to political parties, but this visit I left a bitter taste in the mouth. Nothing to do with the spirituality of other temples we visited in three weeks in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. Too bad, it was the last day of our stay in India.",0
"One of the best Iskcon temples in the world. Spacious and situated on top of a hill, it has a very calm and serene atmosphere. The prasadam served is amazing. The moorthy of Lord Krishna is just amazing. A must visit place.",1
It is not just a Temple it is Heaven,1
Hari bol,1
"Iskcon Temple, Bangalore is spread across 7 acres of land and it is the one of largest Iskcon temples in the world. It The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is a devotional tradition based on the teachings of Bhagavadgita and the Bhagavat Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam). You can find 4 large gopurams for the temple each of them are connected through a glass canopy. The entire temple forms the ?Hari Naam Kirthan?, you can find gold plated Dwajastambha which is 17m high and also gold plated Kalash Shikara which is 8.5m high. Free tasty prasada is offered from morning till evening in the temple premises.",1
"it is a new generation temple. while you are in Q, they make you chant hare rama , hare krishna. That is new and wonderful idea Visited October 2013",1
Famous Place of Lord Krishna . good management.,1
Excellent Hill top Radha Krishna temple.Well maintained.Multiple Divine stores are available.Charity by name Akshaya patra run by this great Institution which benefits lakhs of poverty students studying in government school.,1
"A wonderful IskCon Temple which takes your heart m mind in a trace,experience sheer bliss n peace.A must see once and more if possible,will visit gaain,Radhey Radhey.",1
Great place for spiritual enlightenment,1
Beautiful temple. Pleasant ambiance. The place is usually crowded. Best time of the day to visit this place is after sunset.,1
The ISKCON is an iconic temple in itself. The one in Bangalore especially is special due to its sheer size and number of visitors it get everyday. Really beautiful from the inside.,1
"Beautiful temple like other Iskcon temples across.. has rush since this is in top 5 places to visit in Bengaluru.. however, I have other even more beautiful temple like that in mumbai.",1
"Nice place to visit, good maintenance and organized darshan. It would have been better if no commercial complex after the darshan.",0
a brilliant place to visit. The awesome images of the Lord and his resort. Beautiful idols that carry away the grief from our minds,1
An superb place for a good time,1
Awesome place in Bangalore must visit this place who comes here,1
Had a great dharshan at ISKCON temple. Amazing arrangements for the devotees by the temple trustees.,1
One of the best places for meditation.,1
"Very Spacious, very well maintained temple. Here one will get opportunity to see Lord Narasimha Dev, Lord Balaji and in main temple Lord RadhaKrishna Chandra. Built in modern architecture style attracts people from all around the country. I had been many times. Must visit if you are in Bangalore and have Lord's darshan.",1
"This place should be in your list if you have devotional bend of mind. In fact, even if you dont, just visit the place for the grand feeling. The place is calm, clean, serene. The food options is as good as any good sweet shop (with same price although). You can take the special pass for quicker access to darshans.",1
"Going to Bangalore always includes visiting ISKCON temple, but this time with my family and wife i felt that the crowd over the years have gone super high but the way the temple is managed is nice. there is a system of doing things. Very accomodative to the oldies and thus i felt the urge of writing about the the management. Great work.",1
"This is one place can well compete with Thirupathi for finding business in everything around devotion. But then, Thirupathi has a heritage and archaeological relevance. ISKCON doesn't even have that. Vast buildings of concrete and marble, this place is surrounded with Bose speakers that chant and hum ""Om"" for that mega serial ambiance and then you will find numerous priests trying to sell you moksha. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r305698989-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",0
"For the devotees there is a good mix, but the surprise is the food. Not sure if it is commercial or otherwise, but on your way out you can pass thru the numerous stalls selling everything from gulab jamuns to chaats to juices http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r302128533-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
Waiting for darshan,1
It was brilliantly constructed with excellent infrastructure. The place is awesome you can be very peaceful when you are leading a stressful busy life. Chanting around with the name of LORD KRISHNA allover the temple...:) :),1
"We visited this temple on the recommendation of many others who had visited before. It, unfortunately, was not to my family and my liking. The temple was far too commercialized. After queuing up in a dated, cramped, fenced off area, once you are through to go in, you pay to put your shoes away, bags away, and I even ended up having to pay a refundable deposit for a shawl to cover my legs up (don't wear shorts, or skirts without something to cover your legs when visiting), plus a further few rupees to cover laundry costs. Once inside, you are rushed through in order to keep the queues flowing. A priest blessed those who offered donation, but abruptly stopped when he felt more donations were required. Once inside the main temple, you are offered the chance to get to the front for a fee. Otherwise you continue to queue at a distance and be ushered through and told to keep moving along. Once you have visited, you are led out through an endless gift shop, which seems bigger than the temple! Prasad was free (!) and generous however. If you want something to tick off the list, then this is a good place to visit, but it left us feeling rather frustrated and we took the decision to avoid the bigger temples after this.",0
I went on school days. it was wonder kovil i had never seen before. neet and clean. when u go there u mind was fully refreshed. i like it very much. if u bangalore don't forget to go iskcon temple.,1
Jai sri RadheKrishna :) :) :) Radhekrishna :) :) :),1
Awesome experience....i just can't thought that inside the gate..the temple is so big....i am blessed,1
A divine and wonderful spiritual experience.,1
"Although we were the only tourists in the temple when we visited it, this temple is highly organized for tourists and the local community. We had to leave our shoes at the entrance and walk through a path all the way up to the temple. After you visit the temple, you walk again through a path that leads you to the souvenir shops, canteen (they offer free food) and get to the end of the journey in the shoes collection. The temple is huge, and no photos are permitted. But even though we couldn't record any memory from this place, I will never forget it. The atmosphere is very intense, and very peaceful.",1
Well maintained. nice to see the lights at night time.the place is quite far from old airport road. But truly everyone will like it.,1
ISKCON temple can be visited any time you wish to have some mental peace.Go with family or friends and have a good spiritual time,1
"I am not much of a religious type , but I have gone there for the view , Kesari bath and Baigan (egg plant ) pakori. According to me they make the best kesari bath in bangalore.",1
If you want to see the beauty of the architecture and lighting go in the evening.. most of the stalls there sell lord Krishna stuff.. you can buy or ignore.. peaceful and neat place to be.. but sometimes gets crowded..,1
Visited this place a few times over years. Its a very beautifully constructed temple and idols are really nice - I always feel nice and peaceful after a visit,1
The ISKON temple in bangalore is really one of the best place to visit in bangalore. The temple is huge and at a great height. The way to main temple premise is very beautiful . You can enjoy the beauty even during rainy times. A must Go place in bangalore.,1

"Exceeded expectations, is worth visiting. Leave aside the prejudices ... enjoy the place, be ready to take off your shoes and literally walk with the feet on the ground within the religious of the local culture.",1
"While entering this temple, you will feel a different kind of energy all together and you will realize that you have come to a place where you can forget all the tensions and just live with a free mind for sometime. Its an attraction from the architectural point of view too, and quite centrally located. A must visit place if you have any plans to visit a temple in Bangalore.",1
This is no more a temple they have made it commercial outlet with cake shops and toys inside the mandir.,1
"I visited the ISKCON temple today. My understanding is that you can only visit while the prayer sessions are in progress. Of course this makes it all the more interesting! I am a Western woman, and wore long float pants/trousers and a large scarf wrapped around my upper half. I was assisted at every step of the way by very friendly people working at the temple who helped with ticket purchase, explaining where I was to go and what to do at each step. I was made to feel very welcome and special even. There were hundreds of devotees there as well and the experience was very interesting and humbling as the people were clearly very devout and focused on their prayer. A great place to visit but make sure you check the prayer times in advance (on the gate and on their website) and are dressed appropriately or you will not be able to enter. (Shoulders and legs covered.).",1
"Divine experience, modern and traditional temple in all possible ways",1
"Stunning place, what an honour to make it there Om sai ram",1
Its always been a wonderful experience being at Iskcon temple.,1
Very grand and clean. Nicely maintained. The decoration is great and so is the whole setup within the temple. Food court is amazing. Lots of tasty items from many cuisines. Annadanam coupons are given after the food court. It would be better to give it before the food court.,1
"This Temple is purely a ""Heaven"" to all the Hindus..",1
"Cool one, not much crowd, well designed everything",1
Its so nice and peaceful place,1
Nice,1
"Divinity, grandeur, cleanliness, festivities, charity, a mind boggling variety of cuisines at an astonishingly affordable prices.... ISKCON is a legend. Shree Krishna Janmashtami celebrations attract lakhs of devotees every year.",1
"This iskon temple is on the lines of other temples across the cities. The experience is good. However if you have visited other Iskon temples, in Delhi or in Bhubaneshwar, you may find it average compared to them. However, if you have a religious bend of mind, not a bad option to have a quite visit to the temple. Visited August 2013",0

"one of most visit place in Bangalore,very peaceful,great feelings,take prasadam and listen sweet bhajan",1
A divine feeling. Always. Great place to visit.,1
Peace of mind,1
Shopping,1
Discipline and very Peaceful and well maintained cleanness..,1
"The temple is on a small hilltop and the premises span across a vast area but is maintained very well. Everything is in order and there is no rush. We went on a Saturday afternoon, there was less crowd and had a very good darshan of the Almighty. After the darshan we got piping hot kichdi as bhog prasad. There are also several counters selling lots of sweet and savouries.",1
Excellent infrastructure... Best temple I have ever seen...Hare Krishna,1
Krishna temple a must visit attraction. Built on a hillock on a huge place. Well kept and wonderfully managed. Eating places and a restaurant is there. Great for a family visit with children. U can take back sweets and prasad. Not to forget there service kitchen for Akshay patra,1
This temple is one of the must see places in Bangalore which is so clean and well maintained temple it's a nice place to meditate at times. Overall a nice place wit all the requirements,1
"This reativly new temple was a big hindu version of Disney Land.... Quite expensive entrance for a temple. I accept the religious dress code so i was not alowed to enter in shorts. I had to rent an Indian lunghi, male long dress. The guards was not polite, almost unfriendly. One lady guard was about to destroy my expensive camera wich i had to leave outside. Inside the temple it was to follow the marked way. Somwhere you was blessed by some holy man. But everywhere there was stands with different things for sale. Worst was the way out with an enormous market with holy souvenirs of different quality, most kitscy plastic things"" made in China"". The holy experience i had looked forward to have dissapeared in a commercial thing. All they wanted was my money.",0
"Very nice temple, lots of parking space still not enough in rush hours... Idols are so beautiful and so nicely decorate",1
Good to see..,1
"This temple is a very special one and a must visit in your list. Once you are inside, you will really feel the inner peace and surrounding atmosphere is very elegant. Nice spiritual shopping you can down in side the temple premises and have some good collection. Visit in the evening will be more appealing.",1
Hare Krishna hare Rama,1
Place of peace and devotion.... Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Hare Hare....Hare Rama Hare Rama Hare Rama Hare Hare....,1
"WOW!!! This is the first thought that would come to your mind as soon as you see this graceful temple. Your senses come to a halt as soon as you step inside the main shrine and you feel like its a heavenly abode. Hand and Leg washing facilities are provided at the entrance where your Bags and Footwear are supposed to be stored. Only visit this temple if you have at least 2-3 hours to spare. Amazing deity exhibitions and temple infrastructure. It has a few shops that sell Krishna deities and accessories for the devotees, and there also a eatery near the exit of the temple that serves south Indian delicacies .",1
Temple is very good,1
Amazing place on this world. Each one shld visit.,1
"The temple complex is very huge, there is enough space for car park. Very beautiful architecture. The main area is really done with some creativity, beautifully sculptured pillars and ceilings with Lord Krishna paintings.",1
away from the city crowd and wonderful and peaceful place to spend time with family holistically. you get food there and there are many stuffs and eateries to have and have fun with family.,1
"I am not very religious in the sense that I am not one to worship too many idols and believe in rituals. I went to this temple purely as a tourist. I did not expect the visit to be so time-consuming; I mean, after all it is just a temple and if you do not sit down to pray and all, how long should it take. But I was wrong. They move inside the temple one step at a time on each ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" chant. This means that you take at least 20-25 minutes just to enter the temple. The temple is very beautiful and grand. The chants and music are very soothing and calms you down. The whole atmosphere is very enigmatic if you ignore the very in-your-face commercial aspect of the temple. (They are selling books and hoardes of other stuff - even the prasadam - at every corner). Overall a good experience but nothing worth remembering for very long.",0
The place by itself gives peace.. lovely ambiance inside.. well maintained and structured.. but lot to walk...,1
"There is something about this place, the purity , the essence of the place and the feeling with which you back. It is really worth spending an evening here with the heavenly touch.",1
"Iskcon temples are available in almost all the major cities, Bengaluru being no exception. It is on the outskirts of the city on a hillock. The temple has adequate parking facility which is rarely found in Bengaluru and this added a sigh of relief to me. The premises absolutely neat and clean with staff maintaining the standards continuously. The worship place may appear a bit crowded but he people maintained order and silence. The main altar was in a well illuminated and a decorated hall which had big beautiful paintings drawn on the walls and the ceiling. The idol of Lord Radha Krishna was mesmerizing people sit a while after the Darshan for chanting the slokhas. With the Mangala Arthi starting at 4 am there are many pujas conducted during the day and the Shayana arthi being the last ritual of the day at 8pm. From the temple one can see the spectacular view of the surrounding landscapes and buildings of the city. There are literature books available in a variety of languages at the exhibition hall including plethora of artifacts. At the end of the darshan, prasad which is food a devotional offering is distributed among the devotees. It is must visit place in bangalore you must not miss.",1
"It is a very peaceful place which is on the top of the hill. But while returning, you would be forced to come through lots of shops. You would feel ashamed if you don't buy anything. White returning it doesn't look like a temple - it looks more like a bazaar.",0
I love this Temple.. Very Nice Management System & Security...,1
Must visit place In Bangalore for spiritual progress,1
"Its always crowded with devotees, you can't escape the rush. It's kind of far away from the city. Morning and evening aarti timinings are even busier at this temple.",1
This temple is nice and has good architecture. You get a very soothing feeling when you visit. You feel so relaxed...,1
"ISKCON Temple complex Bangalore is a very peaceful place once inside; its only painful to get in! if traffic on the road doesn't get you, the boisterous devotees thronging the temple will, even though the temple authorities have taken utmost care to ensure that the people are least bothered. Cleanliness, hygiene, is a class apart. The extremely beautiful insides of the temple and the soulful spiritual music / bhajans will certainly transport every soul to another world! Routing the visitors through various shopping/eating areas in the complex is quite tedious and unnecessary - not that they are boring or unhygienic, but those who do not want to needn't - purely my personal opinion. Definitely worth a visit, if not many.",1
Easily accessible on the special Bangalore Ac bus tour route. Large hall and people allow you your time. No typical Indian temple push and pull. Very attractively decorated deities and temple is constructed in style and class. The only flip is the pushy sales behavior of some staff for memorabilia,1
"Yes I love this Temple because it is a temple of Lord Krishna and gives a devotion filling , attractive look ....... Etc .",1
"The place is located on a hill, very neatly kept, very disciplined crowd. Note only is the place spiritually thrilling, you get excellent vegetarian food at reasonable prices.",1
"There is no word r no characters to explain the felling of that place. The only words are ""HARE KRISHNA HARE RAMA""",1
Nice Radhe Krishna temple. Cleanliness. God decorated nicely. Holy place. Restrictions on clothes which visitors must take care. Still they provide some clothes for such people that they charge around 20-30 RS.,1
"Lord Krishna, The enlightened and the destination. We might have listened his stories, must have heard geeta, and from all these we have an imagination of how he would be. The moment, i have seen krishna in ISKCON, i was surprised, to see the imaginations are on print. Really one of the best places in bangalore to visit.",1
Hare Krishna hare Krishna Krishna Krishna hare hare Hare rama hare rama Rama rama hare hare,0
The temple is excellent place to visit so do visit. Take the Rs 300 Special pass and in includes puja etc. Laddos very tasty so do buy extra.Visited September 2014,1
Great place beautiful temple,1
This was the biggest ISKON temple so far I have visited. Very peaceful and clean and lot of steps. Temple with many shopping and food options. It has nice restaurant with good food. One more restaurant is in the campus with buffet option.,1
"Beautiful premises with divine vibes. The management is excellent starting from the point you enter till you exit getting the prasadam (holy food). The ""Hare Krishna Hare Radha"" chants inside the temple complex along with the beautifully painted interior roofs create a mesmerizing effect on the soul. You can buy a lot of good books and merchandize too here. The food stalls before the exit with a variety of healthy and all vegetarian preperations are not to be missed.",1
"Such a great holy place best in everything Arti , it's very spiritual feeling in iskcon.good for family devotional visit.",1
"I went many times with family and friends. It is one of the best temples. Except the crowded market place at the end, it's very peaceful. Specially if you go in the morning when they open it is awesome. It's a must visit place",1
"The must watch place in bangalore,without miss.Awesome experience .",1
Temple of Krishna.It has a ac marriage hall with attached dining hall.Serves the best Satvik food.Leftovers are donations,1
"I went sightseeing in three people. Wide in unexpectedly, it is the most deep atmosphere in the way of local. Worship barefoot. People of shorts will visit dressed in cloth (rental). Yes Snack Corner, ants and souvenirs, is there a buffet restaurant, it has to some extent touristy, is only less expensive that the local-friendly, is heterogeneous. Worship time will take quite. Severe in 1 hour.",1
I love krishana,1
It is a very beautiful very neat and clean temple,1
Place for finding inner peace,1
Really an enchanting experience..quite nicely managed campus...with all amenities....even for the life members the resthouse is nicely managed with free food( i loved the shreera with kesar) I stayed there for 2 days as every life member is entitled to stay for max. 3 days.. Situated on a hill....,1
It's a wonderful holy place ....True devotional feelings in and around temple.. Feeling lucky to have visited such a beautiful temple of Radha Krishna..,1
To much problem for Parking all ask for Money,0
"The facility is well organized, you get at the entrance almost imposed a ticket, but the entrance is free. Only if you want on the ""fast track"" through the temple, you have to pay admission. But that is not necessary at night, there's not so much going on ... You go through the temple and then you have to still struggle through countless shops / stalls and I felt a bit like IKEA, but stop without abbreviation ... Am end is still offered something to eat, but since everyone should decide for themselves whether to accept it and tried. I do not have it, which was no problem. Clearly, as in all temples here you go barefoot, are the shoes from the entrance and bring it at the end of the tour again. So it's also a good idea to have wipes while ...",1
"Hare krishna hare krishna.... That's the only thing which was heard everywhere on the eve of lord's krishna's birthday. A beautiful temple, beautiful vibrations and most importantly, feeling connected. Highly recommended",1
It is a tourist place as the Temple is very big. Very huge variety of prasad sold. Many tourists visit this place,0
Spiritual and refreshing... Full of peace...,1
Hare Krishna..hare Krishna.. only word gives all the strength and energy.. this is place where we can get good knowledge on bagavad Gita,1
"The most happy tears,I shed on visiting and had Darshan of Lord Krishna and Radha",1

Great saintly people. Wonderful architecture and some delicious steaming prasadam.,1
"Very nice place, feel calm being there, very quit & relax able to sit inside the temple, & most of a thing you will really enjoy the food items sold there, very good variety of food with a great taste",1
"Reaching this place is very convinient by bus,metro,cab etc.Beautiful and very neatly maintained ,Good to visit anytime",1
"This ISKCON temple, built on Hare Krishna Hill, Bangalore, is dedicated to Radha-Krishna. It is the best and largest temple complex among Iskcons. Architect of this temple is a mix of south Indian style and contemporary style. A big garden is also there. Two sets of 108 granite steps are very impressive. Four temple towers; a Gold plated 36 feet high ""Kalasha"" at the top; and 56 feet high gold plated ""Dwaja Stambha"" (tallest of its kind in the world) enhance the beauty of this temple. Main temple Hall can house 2000 devotees at a time. There is another hall where relegious rituals are performed. A Multi - vision cinema theater shows messages from Vedic scriptures. It observes very strict rules. You are allowed to enter only with full trousers or Dhoti, fully covered shoulders and waist. No shoes. No camera. You have to deposit them at a cost. You have to deposit money and pay laundry charges for borrowing a Dhoti. All said and done, this place is worth visit.Visited September 2014",1
"Temple built on a hill with panoramic views, it is a blend of modern technology and spiritual harmony. The cultural complex was built to promote Vedic culture and spiritual learning, and is full of shops selling souvenirs and devotional objects. During the anniversary Krishna and Balarama Rath Yatra are thousands of devotees. Too modern and again to see what they like.",0
Nice,1
An extremely well organized temple which gives a feeling of tranquility. It's clean As well. Must visit in bangalore,1
very nice temple it is tourist place one must visit this temple shopping malls are nearby good things to purchase in bangalore Visited October 2014,1
Lovely silent place...in green city...Hare Ram.. Hare Krishna...,1
One of the famous temple in Bangalore and they conduct many events here especially for school students I had once bunked my school and went there to participate in drama with my friends and I have not given that 5 star star because of the high price fixed for the items and food available there.,1
This place is like heaven. the architecture is so mind blowing. the view at night is so overwhelming.,1
Worship,1
"Pure , clean, pious. Too good.",1
"It's a glorified mall for religious purpose. You have all type of gods to serve your requirement. Many options available as per your budget to please the god. Can be visited as a tourist place, the way we visit any other shopping complex/mall.",0
I am no one to review or rate a holy place but this place is magical and divine. Try and attend evening aarti and if possible visit on special days like janamashtmi etc.,1
do not forget to see iskcon temple whenever you visit bangalore very auticious temple to be seen and peace tobe experienced,1
Simply Heaven on Earth... Door to Goloka Vrindavan... Hare Krishna,1
One can really indulge themselves into the path of krishna by making every step towards makkanchor by chanting Hare Krishna mantra. I visited this place for once and i just loved the peace over there. Must to watch place.,1
I don't feel this as temple it's posh area. It may be a mistake in my view about a temple.,0
"Excellent construction, amazing experience. Beautifully designed and able to handle huge crowds, nice very big hall so that pilgrims will not get tired while darshan.",1
The temple is located very near to Yeshwantpur Station.Very well organized. Serene place to be in. The place is clean to the core and well maintained. Feels divine to just go there and spend some quality time with own self. Peaceful environment,1
Just visit ..not weekends as it is fully crowded .. Just take tiem out on weekday and share time with GOD,1
"A temple in which to learn the ritual of the worshipers of Krishna. In the first temple, by making the 108 steps chanting the mantra, you're getting into the environment. Go through the second temple and climb to the third where if you want to give a donation make you a puja or ritual of blessing (with prasadam, poster and book included). Then sit in the middle of the room to hear the music, people watching and meditate for a while. On leaving the shopping and restaurant veg eta super-pure",1
Very pleasant place,1
Its a very big temple in the city and is definitely a must visit. Good place to sing bajans and meditate.,1
Very nice place,1
Everything is good there...Except the atmosphere which is created by staff and people that one should lean in that Hare Rama Hare Krishna's bhakti...Like the place but not the atmosphere there as Mathura or Vrindavan...Decoration is good... Again lastly that environment I missed..,1
Peaceful,1
"The iskcon temple is in Yeshwanthpura. The temple is very clean and well maintained. The main hall has beautiful idols of Sri Krishna, Radha, and Balaram. Well mannered volunteers manage the crowd very well. Nice and good food's and sweet's.",1
We went on krishan janamshtmi though it was rush there which was expected but everyone gping in queue. it looks good. mandir was decorated veey nicely. Must visit if you go to bangalore.,1
"Nice place to visit with family or friends,the area is vast and it comprises of three temples,main being the Radha-Krishna temple housing the main deity,among the other two temples one is dedicated to lord narasingha the incarnation of lord vishnu. The main temple is beautifully decorated and one should not miss the evening aarati over there. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r293163240-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
Lord Krishna with Radha and other gods near by Yaswanthpur Railway Station,1
Very tranquil environment for soul. May lord Krishna bless all mankind.,1
"First of all i'm not an atheist.By the experience gained by me after visiting this place i'm reviewing this.Coming to the main part the temple is simply amazing by it's architecture and cleanliness.Best place to visit with family on a weekend.Once the darshan is done,you will enter into the shopping mall.There is no way to skip this part.One more thing is don't miss the free prasadam which is finger licking good :)",1
The single peaceful place in Bangalore. This is a temple of lord krishna and radha.,1
"I had been to ISKCON temple yesterday i.e., 21.07.2017. Orderly arrangements and marvelous construction fascinated me. The various poojas conducted there taken us to such a divine atmosphere. I felt positive vibrations there.",1
The very essence of divinity and serenity in a single place:) the chants and the aura is takes you through a peaceful ride,1
A must visit place when you are in Bangalore. Weekdays are preferable if you are a tourist. You can combine it with v...,1
"Despite being the largest ISKCON in the country, this place fails to give you a peaceful mind mainly for what ISKCONS are famous for!!",0
Keep and calm place .It is built on hill with a superb architecture .The 30 feet door beside the lord Krishna statue makes you feel the cold air passing in front of you.,1
Such a nice ambiance and a great place.My parents were very happy and impressed with the grandeur of the temple. Worth visiting.,1
"2002, if i am not wrong I first came here. my dad was impressed and took life membership in ISKCON, later visited many times and stayed in their guest houses. Krishna is the same may be in Bangalore or in Bombay but the temple is so clean and pleasant ( at least on weekdays where the rush is low), many time felt it become commercial on seeing those shops selling food, cakes etc etc ., but the happiness after seeing Krishna suppresses all of these",1
Don't miss this place if you are planning sightseeing in Bangalore. Very calm place especially inside the main temple. Weekends bit crowded and you may need to wait 30 mins to 1hr to get the darshan,1
"The temple is not like the ordinary temples with classic architecture but this is like a modern temple. I like the place for the management and clean environment. There are lot of stalls inside for different kind of prasad, sweets. You can buy if you wish too. They also have fast food service counter, you can purchase and enjoy the taste of sweets and snacks. There are lot of galleries for purchasing books, toys, ornaments etc. Loved the place. Worth the visit and a must visit place.",1
"Nice place... should go once.. it is peaceful and beautiful place. But If you go on some festive time, you might need to stand in log queue for darshan.",1
It is very good place to get peace of mind n pray to God... Hare ram Hare ram ram ram Hare Hare.. Hare krishna Hare krishna krishna krishna Hare Hare..... I like this very much,1
"i have seen delhi ISKCON temple as well,i think this is bigger than delhi temple ,holy place,feeling relax ,lift,food are there.",1
Beautiful place,0
Amazing place..Spectacular,1
"More of commercialized place and less of a temple. They have designed darshanam path in a way where you get darshanam in 10 mins but after that you will keep roaming between their market for half an hour where you will get almost everything like food, religious books, appears etc. And everything is costly.",0
"Its curiosity and divinity both when you visit first ISCKON Bangalore. The temple is located in picturesque viewpoint location. The moment you assemble in queue for darshan of Sri Radha-Krishna you start getting into religious environment. You will feel peaceful inside once you had darshan after a long walk in queue. The temple is really very good little crowdy bet well managed. The souvenir shops are on the way inside the campus while coming out of temple. You will tempted to buy so many articles, photos, statues, etc etc its costly but everything in single place makes it worth. A must place to visit ! HARI OM ! Visited February 2014",1
Nice peacefully place to go in Bangalore...loved it,1
"The temple is located on a hill, which gives a nice view of the city around. It is very unique, since the architecture is a fusion of traditional and modern styles. The temple complex has got 3 temples , 1 in each level/floor. The deities include: Lord Laxmi Narasimha, Lord Venkateshwara, and Radha- Krishna. Not to forget the prasada distributed here, which is very good. On the way to exit, one could find many stalls which sell spritual books, paintings, photos, ethnic wear, food items and many more",1
On my work,1
ISKCON temple is such a place where you can feel real peace of mind. the infrastructure is like so big & nice. You here all chanting Hare Rama! Hare Krishna! till you move inside the temple it's alike 108 times. Thank you,1
"nice temple,nice environment",1
I have Given out of out for Maintenance and power of God,1
"Such an awesome temple! An absolute must visit! Be sure to see Aratik and take some of the wonderful prasad. Most importantly don't leave without a book by Srila AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada! Just having a book is most, most auspicious for all the residents of your home",1
"I visit iskcon very frequently, the place is nice & tidy always, It look more beautiful during night with the lights on, it always has some activities going on & filled with devotees...",1
Very Nice and peaceful . Beautifully built . A must visit for any person following Krishna . The Krishna Birthday Celebrations were just mesmerizing,1
Beautiful and very clean temple. you will find this place very peaceful in mid of noisy city. Lots of souvenirs available for purchase with huge variety of eatables too at exit point. Prasad which was given at exit is really tasty and we enjoyed a lot.,1
a very nice temple located on hill giving great views of surrounding landscape and also a serene place to spend time. especially beautiful in the evenings.,1

Great place to visit. Good ambiance.,1
"Awesome place ... one can get peace of mind here. I have visited twice.... Not as big as ISKCON Mayapur W.B... But I recommend this place to visit at least once. Neat & clean.. well maintained ... It's near to Yeshwanthpur Railway Station.... It's well connected from every part of Bangalore. ... one can buy books also from the counter .. like Bhagwat Geeta & other books on Sri Krishna, Mahaprabhu Chaitanya. .... A must see place for Sri Krishna & Mahaprabhu's devotees. ... Highly recommended",1
Spiritual place,0
Its not a temple.,0
"Just like other ISKON temples, this one is equally beautiful and enchanting. However, something which distracts is the commercial aspects (of selling products and artifacts), right through the sanctum sanatorium. Business of faith has always flourished, but when it comes this close, it may not go down too well with everyone. Take your call, and be prepared.",1
Peace to mind.. After so many years still clean n calm.. Love it... Hare Krishna hare Krishna Krishna Krishna hare hare.. Hare Rama hare Rama Rama Rama hare hare...,1
ISKCON Bangalore is a gift from HDG Srila Prabhupada and preaching Lord Chaitanya's message with modern technology by following instructions(Yukta vairgya Principle) of Srila Rupa Goswami......,1
Beautiful modern temple right in the heart of city. Can get an almost 360 degree view of temple from metro!,1
"ISKCON Temple is an interesting place to visit although I was disappointed that no pictures are allowed inside, also due to the location of the temple it takes some time to get there and there's usually a lot of trafic on the way there",0
Jai Jai Gopal Jai Jai Jai radhakrishn radheshyam radhakishan Hari Kishan,0
I Love to be here. Loads of peace and the environment is very very good. But the Shopping here is a bit expensive though!,1
"Very good temple, but closed by 8.30",1
Visited the ISKON temple for last month .Good place and get nice prasdams.Very gud place to meditation,1
Very good and calm place. Very crowded and small. Difficult to park car outside. But very peaceful. Inside the city.,0
It is a very big and super temple,1
Chanting in the temple gives your body n soul calmness which is just uncomparable. Shold try to be at a time just before the dusk to enjoy temples beauty both in sunlight and artificial....,1
Very nice Krishna temple,1
Hare Rama Hare Krishna,1
Prasadam is awesome..,1
Good place for a devotional retreat. They often conduct programs on YOGA.,1
Very good temple and a peaceful place. There is a Orion mall near this temple. We can easily spend one hour in this temple and go to Orion mall and spend time there. There is also wholesale metro shop. We can spend time there also.. We can easily one day in this area,1

Nice place,1
I have seen so many temples of ISCKON in India but this is one of the biggest i have ever seen . The one in Mumbai is considered to be the biggest one but this has extended bigger than that. It is a huge temple which is beautiful and a must visit place in Bangalore.,1
This is a place to go for whenever you have guests from different town. The temple is marvellous and environment completely peaceful. I even enjoy the Prasad counters and variety of food available.,1
"Peace and calm transcend tranquility, if that was ever possible. Simply can't be said better than that!",1
This temple is very beautiful and one of the few large temples I have visited. Worth a visit to this holy place of worship.,1
Holy place,1
Best ISKCON temple in the world...,1
This is more of commercial than religious... the view is beautiful. Usual hare krishna place. Avoid this place during janmashtami as it will be too crowded.,0
The best peaceful place ......it has it's own charm and something special....sometimes even silence is also good and best .....loved it lot,1
should visit..its a beautiful architecture with the faith in god and beautiful sceneries...The langar is also good if u r foodie... :P,1
"I've been there several times and on each visit, there?s something innovative to look forward to. I guess it?s got to do with the fact that world over ISKON has a culture of serving good food to its devotees and in generous quantities, a practice set up by its founder AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. There are stories about Prabhupada serving a lavish Sunday brunch to its devotees. The food culture is so strong in ISKON; it?s no surprise that Higher Taste too follows the same concept.",1
"Very nice Sri Krishna Temple in Bangalore, areal view of this Temple is so nice",1
Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare ... all over the place and makes you feel divine. This also has a party hall for events.,1
Very big temple at Rajaji Nagar. Would recommend to visit on week days since there is less rush. The deities are surrounded by Gold plated structure. Somehow the temple has more selling places and appears in increasing the revenue from sales. Worth visiting.,1
"i visited the temple on my birthday. Since i am one of the patrons, they send an invitation one week before hand. They confirm over telephone a day earlier whether i will be visiting in morning or evening. i am allowed persons. This year only 4 of our family visited. We reached the main temple though a lift. Wheel chair facility is also available. Promptly the securities or the reception persons help you out. One of the swamijis welcome you at the temple. Notice is put that next puja will be at 7:1 am. Till then they make you sit comfortably - even on chairs - and chant here rama here rama, rama rama here here, here krishna here krishna, krishna krishna here here with a japamala. Sharp at 7:15, swamiji takes you in front, 3 pujaris come and do the ceremonial waking up of the deities. The same swamiji guides you to Lords Narashima and Govinda temples to do the puja. Again at main temple special puja and archana is done for all the families of birthday devotee together. Not only theertha is given, you are given water to wash hands and a towel to wipe. Great. Then they guide you to the dining hall for heavy breakfast. The swamijis make you chant loudly before breakfast. Though coffee is not served, they serve hot badam milk. Everything minute to minute punctually done and guided silently - no shouting - no pushing. Peaceful atmosphere. The workers were wiping the few drizzle drops so that we don't slip in the marble floor.",1
"A true place to get enlightened. Beautiful paintings, beautiful deities . Perfection.",1
Very good Very nice,1
The temple is nice but I felt it to be too posh and didn't feel any of the usual bhakthi that is felt at other temples. Two things put me off: the large noisy crowds and the numerous businesses being run within the complex. It didn't have the ambience of a temple at all: felt more like being in a busy shopping area. I felt that more importance is given to money than God: very disappointed.,0
"Very nice environment, calm and relaxed",1
The visit to ISKCON is always a Celebrations. My daughter loves the visit always. It is well organised and yet the sanctity is well maintained,1
"I've visited the temple few times in past, with family, friends separately. The temple is very much organized in the manner the devotees are handled. Right from the moment we enter the temple, to the time we leave the premises, the temple is very clean and you feel pleasant. The first thing after we enter the temple, we can start with taking 108 steps while chanting ""Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare"". Some people choose to continue into the main temple complex without doing this. It is up to the devotee. The temple complex is huge and you can sit and meditate after darshan. While coming out, we can see many shops selling souvenirs, food stalls etc. There is also a room on the way out, having photo gallery of different swamis of ISKCON. On the way out, we can take prasadam, sit outside near water fountain. Best time of the day to visit is evening. All the while, we feel at peace",1
Too commercialized but effective to broadcast the message of Lord Krishna. Beautifully made in architecture as compared to the other temples of ISKCON,1
"The Indian Society of Krishna Consciousness has built this magnificent edifice on a hillside .Thousands of pilgrims visit the temple,walk up the steps praying all the while as the need succour from their day to day problems.As they ascend and pass through the portal to the sanctum sanctorium they hear the music of the devotees singing paens to the Lord.A ""darshan "" or view later they descend through a number of commercial establishments as the Indian tradition of buying a keepsake in a temple prevails.All devotees are treated to a free meal while exiting the temple and vegetarian meals are provided to lakhs of people every day.The ISKCON group also provides free midday means to poor school children as part of their Corporate social responsibility.A Noble cause indeed.",1

one of the best attraction in Bangalore.... who ever visiting Bangalore must visit this place..... I visited with family and with friends also...... mix of spiritual and commercial place to buy hand crafts.....,1
When I was in bangalore more than 7 years I was regular vistor here. When I go and sit in side the temple it was so good temple inside interiors are so nice .,1
"Loved this place.. so big, quiet and peaceful.. I could spend there all day and not have enough. Not only looks really beautiful but its also quiet interesting, even if you are not so interested (or you don't know so much about the culture) you will like the place. You can learn something when you go there.. When i came there was some ritual happening (can't tell what it was). When you enter you have to leave your shoes at the door. Also I couldn't take my camera inside. But it didn't bother me and allowed to focus on the whole experience. I am still not sure if this place is free or no.. someone sold me a ticket for a prayer or a talk with one of the masters in the temple. I think it wasn't necessary to enter, however it wasn't expensive and I was glad that I could donate something for this place. There is also a place in the temple where you can get food and drinks.",1
It is lord Krishna where need to see in the large no of devotees we need to be in presence of lord Krishna if we are there at place it is place where only name of lord Krishna listens such a pleasant,1
"ISKCON Temple Bangalore is the most serene and Spiritually elevating Place in Bangalore. The Deities Sri Sri Radha Krishnachandra are so very adorable, you would want be in front of them forever. Temple is very much unique in its architecture to celebrations of festivals to Mouth watering Kichadi Prasadam to cleanliness to charity to social responsibilities to everything. With all personal cherishing experience I have had at ISKCON Bangalore Temple, I feel awesome to have come across it and stil",1
"ISKCON at Bangalore is like a haven of peace and piety, amidst the hustle and bustle of a busy cosmopolitan city. The air itself calls out 'Krishna', even if the taped chants of 'Hare Krishna' weren't played at a loop. The first thing that strikes one about the temple, is the breathtaking majesty of its facade - this is one of the most beautifully designed Krishna temples ever! Situated high above a hill, so be prepared for climbing stairs, the Temple itself commands a panoramic view of the city, from the right side of the sanctum area. Remember the dress code and wear covered clothes - I was in a short sleeved dress, so wore long pajamas underneath to cover up. Also check the temple's timings before you go, it closes during the afternoon. There are toilet facilities (a bit better than primitive) that can be used if there is an absolute need to go. Shoes can be checked in at the shoe racks (hold your nose though, because that area smells of feet!), but to me, the best part is the luggage counter, because you can visit the temple and then go straight to the airport/railway station if you're so minded. There are a 108 steps that one is advised to stop at and chant the complete 'Hare Krishna' mantra for awakening inner consciousness and focusing on Krishna. Two smaller sanctums devoted to 'Prahalada' and 'Prabhupada', lead you on to the majestic main sanctum, which is done up in gold and will elicit an audible wow from most first timers. Onwards from the 'darshan', and there is a book counter, and the exit ways lead to other halls where one can purchase jaap maalas (Hindu rosaries), crystal trees, incense and essential oils, and a whole lot of other things besides. There is a lovely bakery too, and a proper Cafe, aptly names 'The Higher Consciousness'. Free prasadam that's basically made of sweetened tapioca pearls, and you can then take your leave, or stay for longer. It took me about an hour, at a rush, including the 108 chants, so perhaps one would be better advised to keep aside atleast a couple of hours for this beautiful sanctuary of inner consciousness. Hari bol!",1
A must visit if you are in Bangalore.,1
"A great spiritual experience is assured by visiting ISKON temple at Bangalore. Neatly maintained. Chanting of Hare Rama Hare Krishna 108 times on the queue is unique. The deities of Radha , Krishna , Balarama are so beautiful that one can keep watching them. Besides these there is also Narsimha and Venkateshwara shrines. They distribute free prasadam (Pongal etc) while coming out. There are good number of counters for buying sovereigns, food items (wide varieties).

Iskon Tampal World Of Famous And Hindu God Of indians,1
"Located in Yeshwantpur, this place is a must visit if you are a believer in Almighty. From entering the place till you finish the visit you immerse into a divine calmness of this Temple. You find people chanting Hare Rama Hare Krishna around the temple right feom the time you enter the temple. The Iskcon temple is beautifully architectured. Photography is strictly not allowed inside the premises. You find many shops inside the place alingwith snack bars which serve hot and tasty Jalebis (one of my fav). For a tourist who is a non believer this might not appeal much but its a personal choice. Parking is easily available as there is loads of space. A must visit in Bengaluru.",1

The AARTHI & Pallaki utsav daily @ 8PM approx is a must On important religious days, if there is huge rush, ISKON operates special counter for senior citizen. They are ferried to the temple in car & then by lift with an escort & are dropped back after making them to have darshan.. It is a wonderful gesture by ISKON, So if senior citizen are there no need to think of rush & climbing... http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r270892247-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html# see pooja.

ISKCON temple is located in the rajajinagar is one of the biggest ISKCON temple in the world. It's a part of the charitable society with the objective of propagating krishna consciousness. This temple has got fixed timings for visit and it's closed from 1pm to 4pm. There is free distribution of prasadam during the visiting hours. It's reachable by road and metro. It's a must visit location in bangalore.,1
Its Big Grand temple of Krishna by ISKON. Best time to visit this temple is morning 7:00.At that time Pooja should not be missed.,1
"A very beautiful Radha-Krishna temple, a must visit atleast once if you are in Bangalore. I have visited many times, feel good in it's peaceful and serene atmosphere in the chaotic city life.",1
Any pilgrim who would enjoy a the grace of god might love. but the speciality is that the place makes persons from any religion to live the peace and ragas chanting the place.,1
"Nice temple, but you may not feel so peaceful. Weekends are a little crowded. concentration is more on selling their products.",1
Best example of architecture. Also the positivity in the temple is good . It should be a must visit if you are in Bangalore.,1
Beautifully chillest place I like,1
Its a very good temple where people can relax..people can get peace...There is free distribution of Sri Krishna prasad to all visitors during the darshana hours...nice place for devotee?,1
MUST VISIT PLACE IN BANGALORE... awesome temple... very divine... clean and well kept.. yummy food... lords prasad is very very yummy....,1
"This is a very religious and crowded place. A temple for devotees of Krishna, you'll find a lot of checking at the entrance and some very strict rules. Cameras are not allowed, nor carry bags and cellphones, which have to be left at the entrance. The best part is probably the main golden shrine of Krishna and Radha inside the mandir where bhajans and dances animate the visit. You will find bookshops, sweet stalls and also ""prasadam"" at the exit. We didn't really feel a good vibe being constricted in following so many rules, I expected to visit a temple and felt like we were going through an airport checking before boarding.... Better visit a temple next time.",0
"A big temple with beautiful details. The exiting though is quite troublesome, make sure you're not in a rush. You will have to go through all kinds of stores and stands before you can exit.",0
Loved it! It is a modern and peaceful temple,1
"Peaceful and beautiful place to visit. Cleanliness is maintained everywhere. The temple has a restaurant, eateries and many souvenirs for sale. Overall the temple maintains all the traditional values with a modern touch. Visited September 2014",1
Spiritual,1
I am not of very religious nature. I visited this temple along with my friend and family. My impression is : it is nice hi fi place of worship.,1
"Pure Divine, worship the true, indefinable place, food to soul, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare",1
"The temple is enormous and beautiful. Must-see, if you are the religious type and you visit Bangalore. You have to cross heavy security checks before you enter. One of the best ISKCON temples, that is well-maintained and peaceful.",1
"place to have blessing of lord Krishna radhe, very orthodox place to spend in western style. have visit.",1
"Once you reach the central arena of the temple,the positive vibrations do touch your soul. Great place to be and experience the peace within you. The only thing that puts off is that the temple management has made the exit from the temple a commercial process; too many shops and too much of commercial approach while walking out. Can be avoided. Also, the visitors must check with temple's website on timings of entry. They are quite strict on the timings !!",1
"The ISKCON temple is a must visit. It is visited by the locals and travelers and hence very crowded. You need to have atleast 2-3 hours for a good darshan and seeing the place minutely.There are quite a number of steps, however they are manageable for normal travelers. Private Cards can go upto a specific point. Better to avoid camera's as you have to keep them with authorities at a specific starting point. There is one toilet at the strting point and then directly at the exit point. Chappals also need to be stored with them, however it is done very systematically without any kind of problems. It is a great architectural work and you can also read the history while in the queue. The main idols are in the huge main hall called ""Hari Naam Kirtan"". As with each Iskcon temple, the idols are just beyond words. After the darshan, you can have many places to shop for souveniors, frames, bags, clothes, books, etc. Best time is to visit between 6 and 8.",1
"Very well maintained place. Clean, neat and tidy. Must visit place. Will feel the warmth and sclience.",1

Phones and cameras not allowed. Take the special 250 Rs darshan ticket. Ull get to see him closer with special aarti. Prasad mei khichdi is very tasty. Do eat at their eatrey, all stuff is produced and manufactured/prepared by them, right from sandwiched to yummy jalebis and rossogullas. They use good quality oil and also maintain hyegine.There was a controversy regarding true ISKCON or individual owner group but im not sure and who cares ? Ya if possible do donate.",1

Simply divine,1
Best place to find peace.! very close to bus stop and metro.,1
"I have been visiting this temple right from the days when the construction started. It has been built grand on a small hillock and has become one of the top attraction places in Bangalore. There are 3 Avatar altars within the temple premise - Lord Narasimha Swamy, Lord Venkateshwara and Sri Radha Krishna Chandra. There is ample space for car...",1
"Even if you are not of the temple visiting kinda person when you are on vacation, i would still recommend this place. Great place.",1
Super...........felt blessed by spending time with Krishna....jai Sri Krishna,1
"We were a large group that had guided tour, we went through the whole temple. interesting to see that religion, that which pulls down the score of all the commercial that must be crossed on the way out of the temple.",1
ISKCON Bangalore is well laid out and a beautiful structure with a well managed crowd control system. The architecture is impressive and the prasadam is superb!,1
Nice place,1

There are prashadams both free and to be purchased, at the basement you will find several shops of books, food, clothes and gods photos. There is parking available at Hill top, no problem for sr. citizen and others.",1
This temple is very huge. It is spread over in wide area and lot of walking is involved. It has number of small small temples all around. It has parking also. One must be careful to reach the temple only during open time since the Main Gates remain closed One just can not enter. The laddoos available there are very tasty.,0
"Nice place , tasty food",1
"Recently I visited this temple, wow..!!! The architecture is truly world class, it's a classy temple with modern amenities, the interiors were soo grand and eligant, the food court inside the premises was soo mouth watering and hygienic, they have excellent parking space, the climate was sooo breazzy on higher levels of temple.. overall it's a must visit attraction in Bangalore...!!!",1
"Temple is great... But it's more like business center. They are asking for money everywhere... Special Darshan, seva etc. They are selling so many products in the name of God. After Darshan it appears more like a mall than a temple...",1
Most beautiful thing you would ever see in life,1
Iskcon temple...is a famous Center for Krishna devotes throughout world..so is in Bangalore. You can have darshan free or paid..which facilitates you for move fast n comfortably for darshans. Temple has almost all facilities and a shoos for buying gifts for children n all age group ppl. You can also find food stall serving food from bakery items to snacks like samosa kachori puffs and many more. Sweets r also available. You can have paid meals at restaurants below the main temple building. You have parking facilities too. Yatri niwas is also available.,1
"Its must visit place in Bangalore ... Like any other ISKCON, its neat and clean ... it is a crowded place but well maintained and disciplined I would say .. keep couple of hours levy incase you are on an express itinerary for Bangalore, but don't miss to visit..",1
"I had been to the ISKCON temple premises to attend a wedding. Since I was there, I also visited the temple. Really a beautiful place and so well maintained. I felt really at peace standing in front of the Deity. A must visit for people travelling to Bangalore.",1
Very spiritual place,1
Mind blowing experience .in a single word ..awesome.,1
The peace I felt there. I can't express in words overall must visit place.The prashada nd every experience was just awesome,1
It's not temple more than that nice place to visit,1
"It is absolutely beautiful place. There is no entrance fee, but they have donation boxes inside the temple which look like a telephone booth. They have a restaurant whose name is ""Taste of Gods"" and they sell Italian foods. Maybe their gods are Ancient Romans.",1
The ISKCON Temple has brilliantly blended the modern world with age-old spirituality that will appeal to the young and the old. Managed by a highly dedicated team it is a must visit spot.,1
I love this place,1
I took my folks to this temple complex on a week day. It was not very crowded - but they had a special ticket which we decided to buy - so going in was a breeze. It is built into different towers - you visit one tower and then move upwards - very beautifully built with a panoramic view of the city. The main tower is gorgeous. The paintings on the roof of the tower are a sight to behold. The statues and idols all decked out in gold and silk create an aura of reverence. We sat in the hall for a few minutes and soaked in the atmosphere. On the way down the hill - you come through the back - through a series of gift shops - it's a neat little time window shopping if you want to buy any religious related articles. Its definitely a place to visit in Bangalore,1
"Regardless of religion, you can stop, sit and ponder the Absolute. Or just watch the bustling crowds of priests and faithful. Although the temple stands out from other decor (bright large interior), orders are typically Indian - surging in the corners bags and empty bottles, and - have the shoes to store outside! A search of his bag (even with number) can then take a moment ... However, an interesting experience, well worth the experience.",1
One of the best temple in banglore . Huge crowd to be seen came for blessings and prayers. ......hare Krishana .....,1
the iskcon is famous krishna temple. and its is decorated very nicely. everyone has to visit this place once. its really nice place. the jaap of hare rama and hare krishna was adorable and touching.,1
It is nice a temple of Lord Krishna. We have chant matra 108 times before entering into it. The is huge and magnificent. The beauty of architecture is just is just jaw dropping. The followers of Lord Krishna must visit this place. Ya but the things inside the temple are bit costly.,0
I had very bad experience there where don't request but force you or try to be over smart in approaching you for donations/ pooja fee etc. Very sad !,0
"The place has a blend of everything ranging from spirituality, A great architectural marvel,peaceful and a perfect place for peace of mind in a hectic place like Bangalore.The entrance to the temple and the main temple situated at the top is a fine example of architectural beauty and one would always hear the continuous chanting of Hare Krishna Hare Rama everywhere.Additionally, the basement of the temple while existing, one will be able to find numerous food stalls and shops for shopping and refreshments. photography is strictly prohibited and they conduct a lot of pujas and prayers during janmashtshi (And very crowded during this time). the temple is open during evening hours and its a must visit place in case you happen to be in Bangalore.",1
Worth a visit for every believing Hindu visiting Bangalore. Huge campus .,1
want a cchange in your life? visit iskcon. A visit changes the life.,1
"Peace at heart.. Must visit place for everyone. Has stalls where you can buy books , CDs .. Found a lot of food stalls too which probably could be reduced or moved out.",1
Its really amazing temple.i love this temple,1
"Nice divine place to be. Will be stunned with the architecture of the temple. Also, spend time inside the premises",1
"Nice place,near to Orion mall.shop and pray because of mall and temple located in same place.Experience metro journey too.we had evenings snacks their. It's amazing.",1
The temple's atmosphere is divine and outstanding. Arrangement is very good. Normally not too much rush to get darshan.,1
The chiming of bells can be heard from half a kilometre away inspite of the madenning cacophany of the infamous Bangalore traffic. You but cannot help to dwell into where your life is heading to in the rat race? This is a motivation enough for you to climb the staircase of the temple and what follows is but a fantastic date with God. The climb up to the temple sanctum sanctorum is a circuitous route and designed to heighten your sense of awareness and belonging with 'Him'. Though the place is fully commercialised yet you cannot miss his presence. Omnipresent. You can hear the chanting Hare Rama Hare Krishna all the way up and beyond. I strongly advise to sit with your eyes closed and feel him as you reach the sanctum. There will be pushing and hustling but the inner peace you experience post that is unimaginable. For the connoisseurs of satvic food there is a satvic hotel that will add to the mystism of your visit. All in all iskcon is one place in Bangalore that can pull you back to human roots. Happy Worshipping!,1
Peace,1
"I was inspired to visit ISKCON after reading the biography of Prabhupada .. though I have been in Bangalore for the last 17 years, I had not made an effort to visit the temple.. I took advantage of the trip of my close relatives from Delhi, all senior citizens, and we decided to spend the day at ISKCON ..we were pleasantly surprised to experience a place, so well organised, impeccably neat and clean, great eye for details, most polite and helpful staff and volunteers, calm, peaceful and soul searching.. the arrangements for senior citizens have been made with great care and compassion.. after spending two hours in the Main Temple, we had the privilege of a very simple and delicious lunch in the cafeteria/canteen at a nominal price(we did not utilize the option of complimentary meal) .. a must visit for one and all",1
This is one of the biggest ISKCON temples. Interior is well designed. A place that everyone can visit. There's a mall(Orion mall) near to this temple.,1
Best place for worship. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna hare hare!! Hare Rama hare Rama Rama Rama hare hare!,1
"Like with any other Hindu temple, keep in mind the temple and aarati timings. For elderly and slightly disabled, there is a lift that can be accessed by car from the other entrance. There's plenty that can be bought at affordable prices inside, like souvenirs, food and clothes.",1
Very nice place... It's a hit with tourist ... Very well maintained and clean place....a bit difficult for elders as you have to walk a little bit and then take steps?,1
"Clean & Well maintained ! Mostly u need not have to wait for a long time in queue ! Interiors , views & food was fabulous",1
Money minded temple. It's kinda shopping mall. Don't consider spirituality in it,1
It is good for people who want peace & blessings.You will get good variety of food items for foodies & shopping for shoppers.,1
"This has become landmark for visitors vising Bangalore. The restaurant - ""Higher Taste"" serves good veg food. I love the 8 PM Aarti....its enchanting.... Its the most cleanest temple I have been in India. Devotees singing the bhajans and dancing to the rhythm of the song looks very divine and get the feeling of ecstasy getting immersed in the Lord's devotion and you would love to chant... Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.....",1
I visited ISKCON temple with my friends. It is must visit place in Bangalore. When you reach there you find peace .,1
"This one of bangalore is one of the most amazing Iskon Temples among the ones that i visited. The whole ambience is beautiful with such beautiful idols of Lord Krishna, we even did chanting of Hare Rama Hare Krishna 108 times, and it was actually very beautiful experience. Have been there two times, and experience is truly worth it.",1
Awesome architecture and amazing planning has resulted in a barren hill being transformed into this temple complex. Very neatly maintained.,1
"I visited the place with my family. For few moments, I feel that I am in a completely different world. I love the Krishna bhajan, divinity of the place. I also enjoyed the food sold as prasad there.",0
The temple is near the downtown area so it allows for some additional viewing of the city. One of many beauties in Bangalore.,1
"The temple is no doubt serene, clean and beautiful.Sadly it seemed commercial, unlike the other temple I have visited here.The security is very strict and importantly you are not allowed in shorts. In that case, you need to hire the traditional dhoti for which they charge ? 500-/, which if you don't have at the moment they might ask you to deposit your mobile, as happened with us.",0
"Great experience visiting this temple. First you go through 2 smaller shrines with idols before entering into the magnificent main temple. Definitely go for the VIP pass for INR 300, otherwise you'll wait in the heat on hot stone for hours (and at least my poor European feet aren't used to that). In the main hall you have enough time then to experience the chanting and worshippers with their idols, after that you go through various stores for books, momentos and food. But this does not detract from the spiritual experience you will get.",1
Peaceful and quiet place. Crowded during holidays. Beautiful and we'll maintained. The main prayer hall is huge and one can sit there and listen to the kirtana. Prasadam is available but you need to get coupons for it. Well organised and we'll maintained place. You can buy mementos as well.,1
Beautiful temple located on small hill!,1
Very good maintenance and i loved it....especially lord krishna was fabulas,1
"Perfect place to spend couple of hours participating in bhajans or just meditating . The bhajans are worth participating in and its a sight divine when it reaches the cresendo....follow up with some high quality food , which is tasty and value for money....",1
It is always a heavenly experience with blissful Darshans of Lordship Shri Shri Radha Krishna chandra Lord Govinda n Lord Narshimha . A very pure place with lot of positive vibrations,1
"ISKCON temple is at Hare Krishna Hill near to Mahalakshmi layout at bangalore. It's always a busy road. Parking facilities available at temple premises. You need to pay for your handycam, before entering into premises and also go through normal security check-ups. You can hear those chanting words of ""Hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare, hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare "" when you enter the Narashima temple. Then you will go through Srinivasa Govinda temple. Really we will feel the divinity and feel peace inside our heart. Main temple is the Sri Radha Krishna temple, poojas were offered everyday.Even you can sit and worship the beauty of Radha and Krishna taking your own time, those moments can't be expressed in words. You can purchase many devotional books, CD's, DVD's, pooja items, dresses and food items. There is a small theatre inside about little krishna's life. If you want to offer an seva or to know more details of ISCKON you can go through Official website of sri radha krishna temple at http://www.iskconbangalore.org. Don't miss the oppurtunity to visit ISCKON temple when you are at bangalore.",1
You can find parking in a mall but finding parking in Iskon wasnt easy for me.. finally managed that too on steep slope.. Got it.. fortunately didnt take much time hence managed to get in at main dome in 20 min .. had darshana.. its commercial.. you need to buy pass to get closer darshana.. well .. its pure & divine... has galleries & food court inside.. overall - we had great time. :),1
Nice place to visit in the early morning & evening. The view from top is excellent during night. The temple is very neat & clean. Good parkin place for vehicles at the top and has easy access. Best time to visit is during Krishna Janmastami.,1
"ISKCON temple at Bangalore is really clean and well maintained, the queues are orderly. There is sufficient parking space for the car and the temple also has a very good Satwik Food restaurant called Higher Taste - which has really good Biryani and Paneer. Be sure to carry a shawl / pull over - as you are not allowed to enter in Shorts or with shoulder less dresses.",1
Very nice temple. Thrills your mind and soul. The marble finish is excellent. Huge temple. Very nice compared to the one in Mumbai.,1
"Its a multiplex temple.Some people may feel it more commercial.As it is under ISKCON it promotes Krishna Consciousness in every means dats all.There is a theatre,sattvic diet restuarant,distribution of books by Srila Prabupada,RadhaKrishna posters and so on.A must visit for any Krsna devotee.YOU CAN CHANT HARE KRSNA AND BE HAPPY DERE! :)",1
"We visited the Radha Krishna temple of ISKCON on 29th December 2015.I teach in Scottish Church College of Kolkata and an alumnus of Scottish Church, Shri Prabhupada Swamy, known formerly as Abhay Churn Dey created the temple.It is situated on a Hill and the ambience is calm, quite and very much religious. The deities are beautiful. The shrine is crowded but the crowd is disciplined.",1
Loved it!! Had beautiful darshan of my Royal king NA,1
"I have never been so disappointed by visiting any temple in my life. You need to pay to get inside, then buy books, then buy goodies and buy more goodies, buy food and eat, buy posters and keep buying. Nearly a kilometer of walk is next to shops within the temple",0
We visited this temple in the month of February of this year.The temple environment and total atmosphere is sooo nice.I highly recommend my friends to visit this temple in there Holidays occation.,1
"More than a divinity of this holy place, it has just become a tourist attraction of Bengaluru.. If u have an idea to purchase anything then it is not affordable for alow/mid/hid-mid class people..",0
"Comparing this temple to other ISCKON temples across India - this would be the lowest ranking. Nothing exceptional. If visiting, try going in the evening around sunset to enjoy the beautiful city views and the lights on the temple.",0
can be termed as a Super facility multi branded Mall,0
"I went for a tour of the temple with business colleagues at the end of a business trip. It was fascinating to look around - both to understand how the temple operates, and to see the way that visitors/pilgrims use it. The gold-embossed alter was quite spectacular. I did think that the number of ""commercial opportunities"" (places where you could buy souvenirs, gift offerings, or put money into collection boxes) was perhaps a little over the top... A word of warning about dress code - my shorts were cut just above the knee, and that meant I had to hire a skirt before I could go in. Not a particularly good look - you have been warned! Also be aware that you have to take your shoes off - and that in the hot sun walking in bare feet gets pretty hot. Don't make the mistake of stepping off the walkway carpets they provide unless you are used to walking on hot coals... Visited April 2014",1
hey Krishna......i heard a lot of times about you and your place really really really you amazed me such a cool looks your are so beautiful nice place even though the place is so rush and busy with many devotees you really given my calmness......,1
One of the best places to visit in Bengaluru. The environment here will grip you in complete peace and divine love for lord Krishna,1
Really amazing spiritual place. A good place to feel the spirituality and the peace over there. You can enjoy the bhajans and feel the belief in the god.,1
"The largest temple in bengaluru. If you are frustrated by traffic chaos in bangalore & need some peace, this is one o...",1
"Its a very beautiful temple of Lord Sri Krishna located on a hill which adds to the beauty, very vibrant atmosphere with bhajans happening inside the main hall.",1
So much crowd that you should have spare time for about 1 - 2 hours for waiting leave aside the time you spend inside. Traffic iaschaotic to reach the place and return back to your place of stay. Do not ask fro parking.,0
"It was really a unique experience to visit this temple with thousands of locals. You can see many Indian gods and how people pray to them. At the end you can buy some sweets or incenses, sandal sticks are highly recommended.",1
"good place to travel, as Birla temple in Hyderabad, lovely sight seeing good ambience and very good hygienic food available",1
Most Peaceful and Best Place in Bangalore.,1
"Beautiful Temple one of the most beautiful once that I have seen, but highly commercialised, after you see the main deity, there is a whole queue full of stalls that try to tempt you into buying all sorts of things. I dont know if all ISKCON temples are like this or not but this one is. They seem to have a special queue for the ""Members"" of ISKCON, Not sure how that works. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r297086055-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
"Visit to this ISKCON temple, which is a great piece of architecture beauty, brings one again and again.",1
"Recommended to visit this place at around 7:45 PM in night when Aarti is done. During Diwali period they organize deepotsava, its worth visiting at that time.",1
Just an awesome place....very well maintained and well decorated..... And they are providing free BHOG....hats of to the TEMPLE AUTHORITY.....Bangalore is a very costly place.... So free BHOG .... just awesome.... And very nice and divine place... JAI SHREE KRISHNA,1
"ISKCON being one of the best temple which you will find in almost all the cities, is a go to place for blessings .The temple is well maintained.",1
Devotional and beautiful,1
"i have liked that there are people available to take care of your belongings. as u can visit this temple in the morning, and u have to go through the queue, inside u can purchased sweets, and take prashad, for your family, ucan take have darshan within 1 hr onc you enterd. the temple is built beautifully, and there are parkings available on the otherside if the temple. very clean area, and worth visiting this beautiful temple.",1
The Bhakts try all possible ways to enroll for donations..thats a very irritating aspect. The canteen is good..food is pure veg and tasty.,0
Lord krish,1
"This is a nice well maintained temple. Located on the Hare Krishna hill, the architecture is marvelous. There is a temple on each step of the hill and you have to cross all the three till you reach the main temple on the hill top. Its over crowded all the time but the crowd management is awesome. There is ample parking space for 4 wheelers / 2 wheelers and shoe keeping and lockers for valuables. The main temple has a very very beautiful idol and has a huge hall with big speakers. The chanting of mantras during aarti is simply awesome. After darshan you can go for some refreshment. There is a cafeteria which serves almost everything from sweets, cakes, samosas etc in the form of prasadams, though a bit expensive, its very well prepared. A must visit to one of the main attractions in Bangalore. Visited July 2014",1
"Made me a complete man, I could understand the importance and purpose of human life. Differentiate between body, mind and spirit soul",1
"this is one of the top attractions in bangalore,vibrant place with full of positive vibrations, i visited few months back, everything was awesome, the chanting of holy names of god(krishna, rama,govinda) gives you new life of happiness, deities are very beautiful, architecture mind blogging, management very good, cleanest temple, food and prasadam very tastier than anything in the world,good crowd management and systematic, nice aerial view of bangalore on the top of the hill, opposite to orion mall and namma metro, personality development class on the lines of bhagavadgita and vedas will surely enrich young people on how to lead a happy life, it changed my life, if you are the most distressed and frustrated person then this place is a must visit.",1
"For typical experience of Hindu temple festivities with several activities going on all around you. Bhajans, Darshana of deities, Pooja, meditation, spiritual audio, books ,pictures incense colourful idols sales, vast varieties of food offered as Prasad of the Lord. Multitude of people from all parts of India. There is a ordinary restaurant and an upmarket restaurant serving sattvic food with devotional music. Great location on a small hillock with ample parking space. Nice colourful fountains and well lit pathways. Overall a wonderful experience !",1
Nice location of the temple on hill Very calm and peaceful place ... Dont miss arti of you visit the place in evening .. Nice food and snacks available at genuine price ...!!,1
"This is one of the best and sacred Krishna temple's in town. The place is more like a tourist spot apart from being a temple. Entire temple has been build very well and it looks quite clean & polished. Temple is a great spectacle to watch during the evening, when the lights are lit up. This is must visit place when a traveler comes to Bangalore. There is another ISKCON Gho-Shala near Kamanahalli, which is not the same as this. At the end of drashan, every devotee is given 'Prasaad' which is quite good. Plan to spend nearly 2-3 hrs when you go there.",1
"Nice temple, fantastic infrastructure, hare Krishna chant gives peace of mind",1
One of the Best maintained temple in India. Actually isckon temples are really good.,1
Vibration of HDG Srila Prabhupada and beautiful Darshna of Sri Sri Radha Krishna Chandra,1
"There is a long entrance line where you can check your shoes and large bags (which are not allowed in the temple) and get a token to retrieve them later. You are required to wear appropriate clothing which includes having neither your shoulders nor legs visible. I had not done my due diligence and I showed up in shorts. After selling me a ticket for 500 rupees (apparently I needed a special access ticket different from most people), they told me they would supply me with appropriate garments. Sure enough after the luggage and shoe check and just before the entrance they rented me a wrap around to cover my legs. 20 rupees + 500 rupee refundable deposit. I appreciate that they had this available as I do wish to respect their place of worship. The people were all helpful and friendly, showing me how to tie the wrap around. It was odd being in a line and along a different path than 99% of the visitors. The special entry pass allowed viewing of 5 separate areas and participation in a short ceremony that included hand washing, touching of flowers and changing. It also included a couple of gifts including a yummy snack, a book written in Kannada and a box I haven't opened yet. From early on in my visit I had a strong feeling of cognitive dissonance. Later in more tour I have explicit issues I can identify that caused it but the feeling started before any of these. Specifically, after the main tour there is an area with signage explaining the Krishna religion. Two struck me, one was of a fish in a beach chair (labeled fish out of water), I definitely identified with that fish. Another explained how it was material things could not lead to happiness or clear thinking. After passing this area I passed through the most extensive set of gift shops, shopping areas and food sales I have ever seen in a religious institution. Towards the end the was an odd juxtaposition of signs for a paid lunch and others for a free lunch. At the very end they were offering a free bowl of some type of porridge. I feel I offended them by not accepting but by that point I was anxious to leave. This temple really is an outstanding piece of architecture and the people seemed genuinely friendly and helpful. YMMV.",0
Nice place to visit,1
Its a great place to go...good feeling...have been there many times...not recently though...want to visit soon with my son...food is good...Prasad is awesome !!!,1
"Maintenance of the temple is excellent, the place is very clean and everything is well organised. After you complete the mandatory security check, you climb the steps to enter into the queue for the darshan.There are many food stalls . Before leaving you can have the prasad, which is delicious",1
"Too much hype and nothing specific about it. It just be visited as an Krishna temple. A lot of space and grand temple but its an mordern temple, with long quaes but great management. Nice food stalls and a lot of ISKON literature, VCDs on sell at the temple exit. To me looking a great marketing venture than a real...",0
Love ISKCON mainly because it takes out all the stress that has accumulated in me since my last visit here. It obviously is a great temple. I feel very much happy and relieved after every visit. Have attended a few programes too. Truely a special place.,1
"One of the largest ISKCON temples beautiful and well maintained and busy temple too. Modern Type of temple, clean and built with amenities which lags in most of the temples. Many foreigners visit this place and is quite popular. Large place and be prepared to walk up and down the stairs in a line. Choose non holiday day to visit where you can enjoy the temple better. It is easily a family event for 2 to 3 hours well spent!",1
"ISKCON is must visit place in bangalore. Its a wonderful temple. You can experience the holiness and peace. Apart from relaxing and meditating, you can also have mouth watering delicacies at nominal rate. A place which is very well managed. Overall a nice experience to have.",1
"The ISKCON Temple in Bangalore is one of the city's most famous. It has shrines of Lord Narasimha, Lord Anjaneya, Lord Garuda, Lord Venkateshwara and finally, the sanctum sanctorum featuring 6 idols of Radha - Krishna. Try and stay back for the closing pooja at 2030hrs - it's indeed a spectacle! The temple also sells souvenirs in the form of arts and handicrafts. It has multiple food outlets. This is one Krishna experience that nourishes the mind, body and soul!",1
Super god super,1
Awesome temple... must visit...,1
"It has neatness,calm and tastey prasada",1
"Its a nice & spacious place, and yet too commercialized. You have dedicated meditation hall and it gives each one their own space in being themself. But too many glittery elements to distract your view. Personally i couldnt get ""Bhakthi (devotion)"" here but would love to visit this place frequently. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r287057381-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
"Apart from the beautiful temple the place has got good parking facilities and all other amenities like toilet, restaurant etc",1
Super,1
"Frankly, I am not a big fan of ISKON temples due to the commercial activities that take place in the temple. This temple of theirs seems to be no different. There is no doubt that the temple is extremely beautiful, and is very well managed to handle the largest of the croud, but once you enter the temple premises, all commercial activities are at the display. They have stalls all around the place, selling stuff like religious books, to idols, to clothes, to food items, to toys, and what not. I believe, a temple should have more of a spiritual relevance rather than emphasis on commercial activities. But yes, this is my personal opinion, and people may differ from the same.",0
well built. Its actually a MNC.,0
Was very relaxing and interesting visit!,1
"ISKCON temple located at Rajajinagar, Bangalore has an excellent ambiance and calmness for any devotee to offer prayers. A lot of buses are there reach this holy temple.We visited the temple last week with family. The metro train also passes in front of the temple",1
"When you visit this temple, make sure you go around lunch time at the restaurant that they have is a vegetarian but simply awesome.",1
This temple is much different from the other ISKCON temples I have visited. This is a blend of South and regulat ISKCON architecture. There are many Perumal sannidhis like in any South Indian temples. But the main Radha Krishna- Chandra idols are like in other ISKCON temples. There are too many shops inside the main temple.... One is forced to go through all of them. But over all a great experience http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r316022434-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#,1
"I visited the temple in very rush hours, but got entry and could take Darshana properly... It is on the way not worry how to reach.. Ola cab is the best option..",1
Must see,1
"The Krishna temple is a nice good, calm and peaceful place. The hare ram chant by the people brings the divinity and makes you feel happy. This is a must visit place if you are in Bangalore",1
"Nice place to eat out, you've so many options to choose from. The discipline, cleanliness and the ambiance is very well maintained here. Very cleanly atmosphere friendly treatment good food well organised. Give a thumbs up and reply if my reviews helps you. Your feedback helps me improve and keeps motivated. Thank you.",1
awesome,1
"This is one of the grand temples in Bangalore. The setup, dresses,decoration and idols inside the temple are very pretty. But a shopping mall starts as soon as you leave the premise of main sanctum. They are selling anything and everything on the name of Krishna. Long queue on snacks counter generally. Some of the other interesting things available in handicraft shops. But still the best value for money artifacts are books. Specially the translation of Gita which is available in ISKON book stores. Parking on weekend could be a challenge so reach to early to avoid traffic.",1
One of the most exquisite modern day temples of India. Well designed & well maintained. Must go to place in Bangalore. The Pooja on Dusshera is amazing. Very serene experience.,1
It's a divine place but each and everything will be business. Maintenance will nice....the prasadam want to give little more it's useful to many poverty people's who ever can't bye and eat.because inside the temple all the food items high cost....otherwise OK it's give refreshing the mind....,0
"A very well maintained, organized, cleaned and well managed temple everything around here is very systematic. Overall great time spend , I think the best place to visit in Bangalore if you come as tourist",1
Hare krishna.............prnam,1
Very nice place. Must visit in Bangalore.,1
Great spiritual atmosphere and excellent prasadam/food to complement. A bit far from center of city though.,1
Peaceful and spiritual atmosphere.... Loved it.,1
"I am an atheist and I still occasionally visit temples to enjoy some solace, which is difficult here. Too noisy and commercial and hence not a place to find solitude for me.",0
Very fancy and beautiful temple. Top level is the temple and the bottom level is the food and giftshop.,1
Heard about the temple through my friend..wanna visit in my next vacation to India,1
"The best maintained and cleanest places of Hindu worship.Lord Krishna looks so beautiful and connects well with all devotees. From dawn, you hear positive energy reverberations through the entire temple. Chanting, singing and dancing puts you in a happy frame of mind. There are many pratishtas of various gods. The poojas are conducted through all the little temples and move to the main temple finally. After the poojas, prasadam is served to all devotees (a fantastic vegetarian breakfast)",1
its a nice place but the exit way is designed in such a way that one has to pass through all the souvenir shops and also the eateries...one is forced to buy something..also one has to plan the visit properly considering the darshan timings,0
Visiting this place with all the culture and people is an amazing experience,1
"Have been to many Isckon temples across India, but this one truly is the biggest of all. Best part is the walk on the 108 sacred stone with Hare Ram Hare Krishna chant. Temple has a divine atmosphere inside with bhanjans been enchanted in the back ground. Best time to visit on weekdays and non-holidays",1
Generally evening time is good to visit this place. The evening arti is awesome. And after that do visit the temple back side. Lots of thing you can check out there.,1
"Beautifully designed, a very big temple, awesome idols of GOD. It seems that god is himself standing live thereat. But all other things are paid. Many more shops rather than GOD has taken place in the temple. A must experience.",1
"A nice Krishna tempel Cud enjoy a complete session of a Krishna habits Was interesting.To take pictures it was forbidden,",1
It is a location which will make you awestruck. A real GRAND place. Three temples in line- two small and the main one. All totally dedicated to the great Lord Krishna. The best part is the line dicipline is maintained throughout. Also many products and food is availaple.,1
very big temple. nice place to spend time with family. beautiful infrastructure. must go if u are in Bangalore,1
My favorite place..! Peaceful and most beautiful place. Shree radha krishna temple. Jay shri krishna.,1
Midday meals for govt schools kids,1
"ISKCON was founded by Prahalad prabhupada, from Calcutta whom decided to spread Krishna's words. It is a very religious place, with many rules and very little freedom to experiment one's individual spirituality. At the entrance you will find devotees promoting Pooja coupons and trying to sell offerings for Krishna, as well as cloak rooms to leave the camera and other bags. There's a lot of security checking and guards which are quite strict... All this sort of kills the enchantment of the place... But I guess its still interesting to see the shrine. After the Pooja, visitors and devotees receive 'prasadam' in a leaf cup. And at the exit, you will find plenty of opportunities to buy gadgets, souvenirs, sweets, books. There are different shrines dedicated to Radha and Krishna. The main temple with the golden shrine has ceiling paintings with Krishna's childhood events. This is more a place where community religion is practised. In the evening, bhajans are played and devotees dance at the shrine.",0
"This place is totally worth visiting . Have been there twice and I like the ambience . the place is situated at a very high altitude and a person can see North Bangalore from this place . The ambience becomes quiet spiritual while chanting "" Hare Rama Hare Rame Rama Rama Hare Hare "" . There is also a food court where you can get traditional odia and Bengali sweets and dishes . Must try for food enthusiastic .",1
"When I find time any day, my first preference is to visit iskcon where I can feel happy and enjoy chanting hare krishna maha manthra with lord Krishna's and shrila brabhupada's darshan and having nice prasadam. Pl chant always hare Krishna hare Krishna Krishna Krishna hare hare, hare Rama hare Rama Rama Rama hare hare.",1
Good place to find mind peace and family outings.there you can find restaurants sweet shop and many more.you have to know that timings 12 pm to 4 pm this temple will remain close,1
"Excellent architecture and beautiful and organized darshans. Very well managed property as most of the Birla Mandir's, across the country.",1
"This is a beautiful temple in the middle of the city. I went there recently and this was my second trip in the past one year. The temple is very organized with security and keeping of footwear. You have to climb steps to reach the temple. Reach during the Aarti timings to enjoy this temple. Check out the Aarti timings of Iskcon from their website. It was a nice experience we took flowers, coconut, and banana as sold by Iskcon for the Deities. On return, we were given all that when we were exiting the main hall. The atmosphere was extremely soothing. A must visit if you are in Bangalore.",1
"Okay, at first the ""Very Good"" rating is for the Temple/ architecture, sadly it's over commercialized. It's like a Temple in a mall. Shops selling books, decorative items, food etc. Placement of shops are such that to exit the temple one will end up visiting every shop. And there is only one rest room that is at the entrance. I feel the prasad (laddu) is also overpriced.",1
"This is a Good place ,you feel so much peace and a divine power of spirituality will touch you Hare Krishna Hare Rama ....!!!",1
"Iskon is more than a temple. It is in Rajaji nagar Bangalore. Situates 3km far from Yeshwantpur Bus station and railway station and 1.5km far from Soap factory Metro station. It is a temple and pilgrim center run by International Society of Krishna Consciouness. When you enter the premices the chat "" Hare rama Hare Krishna"" will fall in your ears.. it is on a small hill.. more than a temple here we got an exhibition center. Books store. A museum.. and you can shop few spiritual stuffs.. All toagather it is a wonderful place.",1
More best place in Bangalore,1
"Spiritual Park is the right word to express this location. Very calm, almost weekend we spend our times here. Will get some food to purchase and Prasadas also. Go on evenings and be the part of Aarthi performing here.",1
This place is really special to me. Gives peace of mind. People of all religions can visit the temple. The pooja perf...,1
Spaciously built. Temple is well maintained. Best part was there was no queue or ticket to enter the temple Food at the restaurant was a disappointment. ISKCON restaurants in other cities like Mumbai serve delicious food,1
Sunday evening time with parents.. reversing time parents taking me to temple.. me taking them now to new age temple.. Divinity,1
"I have been to many temples in North India but this one in south I personally like. What makes it different is their system to enter the main temple is designed such a way that no stampeding can happen. They make you chant ""Hare Krishna"" for every step you take and this way the entire queue is well managed.Though the place is getting commercialized but I feel its fine as they have to maintain huge campus and free food facility for the needy. There are books and other items which one can buy as souvenirs to this place. Over all, will recommend this place to all people with religious belief. Visited September 2012",1
"Connected by Metro, Bus, Train this is the best Iskcon Temple I have visited.. Temple is beautiful, situated on a hill and there is a sense of positivity inside it.. Must visit when in Bangalore",1
"Bangalore is known for his traffic jam and as a densely populated city, this city has very fewer places where you can have both family and silent place to have. ISKCON Temple of Bangalore provides both to you. A large place with a lot of spirituality which not only gives you a positive energy but also takes you out from the crowd of people full of tensions to a group of people with calm and strong minds. A must visit place for everyone and also you can do lot more. The charm of Lord Krishna and his dressing is unique. You can also get lots of books on mythology and spirituality. Free food is also one thing that adds this place to a uniqueness.",1
"This was the first temple i visited and subsequently went back 3 times. It is free entry - follow the locals not the tourist route if you want a real experience, take time to read the signs it will help you to understand what the temple represents. Visited September 2013",1
"A fine example of how a temple can play a role in our life Divinity - serene and simply fantastic Simple Q system, paid and regular 1 feet away Feeding the souls and bottomless bowls Spiritually uplifting classes, programs Cultural oriented cultivation with captivating classes Showing Satvik food without onion Garlic is tastiest All senses attended to with magic of Lord Krishna HARE KRISHNA",1
Temple Interior and Exterior is well made/decorated and maintained. Friendly staff and can view good scenery when reached on Top.. Once can attain peace with Lord Krishna Chants. Must visit for Lord Krishna followers. Please avoid on Janmashtami as it will be heavy rush at that time.,1
hiteck temple,1
"one of best place to visit in Bangalore , you will get peace of mind , good info about humanity and how to lead life this you will get by speaking with the good people in temple.",1
Very good temple..,1
Very good management Temple looks nice View wise completely nice,1
Iskcon temple offers virtually everything for the spiritual aspirant. Lovely opportunity to chant the Maha Mantra and climb the 108 steps to receive the Darshan of Lord Krishna.,1
"It will totaly change your life. I hav no word's hare krishna Hare krishna ,krishna,krishna hare, hare hare Ram hare ram ,ram,ram hare ,hare.",1
Powerful and big temple for lord krishna,1
Temple is very clean and relaxing...It has become commercial.. During exit they made it compulsory that we pass through,0
This is my 4th visit to this beautiful temple. The vibes are great and the temple is really worth visiting. It's extremely clean and beautiful. You will feel the peace and bliss while having darshan of Lord Krishna there.,1
"Expand thou Iskcon..... spread the grace of the almighty into the minds ruined by Kali ,to purify them!:)",1
"This temple is too much commercial. When you enter, they will ask for special ticket. Inside temple, they sell Books and Prasadam. A team will be waiting for you to ask for donations. The moment you start coming out, you will find huge market with costly items for sale including food items. You can spend time shopping and trying multiple food items.",0
Nice serene place but food there is a little pricey,1
Awesome place. You get peace of mind & eat lots of tasty food,1
nice,1
very peaceful and spiritual environment,1
Very peaceful well organised temple special ticket service if you want to go fast use fast service ..well organised,1
Beautiful temple and very peaceful in the early mornings. The restaurant here serves really great static food.,1
Peaceful temple,1
"You should see this when in Bangalore, but to have this rated as one of the top things to do is confusing to me. Yes, the temple is beautiful, but photos aren't allowed. While in the temple, you spend more time being ushered through endless shops than in the actual worship areas. The whole thing felt like more of a money grab and proselyting ploy. You should see this, but don't expect it to be the highlight of your time in Bangalore.",0
Nice,1
"Chant, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare ... and be happy. what a place !!! peaceful , calm, heaven , no words to describe, when you are at GOD's place , singing - dancing - chanting the Mahamantra , what else you need? nothing more needed in life other than Krishna Love.... Please go to this lovely place and forget everything in Krishna consciousnesses.... As a devotee of ISKCON i suggest you to go to temple and see how other devotees are preaching about Krishna consciousnesses, take part in aarti , dance with devotees on Krishna Mahamantra and purify your self from all sins you have ever did. Hare Krishna",1
"it was a beautiful temple,with magnificiently dressed radha krishna idols . It was evening time with a great crowd but keeping patience and following the system, i could manage to visit the temple.",1
One of the best ISKCON trust temples . I never had been to such recently man made architecture to offer prayer to lord ShriKrishna. The experience at worship place can't be described in words its worth experiencing at the place itself.,1
Nice temple,1
This is an interesting place to visit and well worth the trip. Take care not to turn up in shorts as my colleague did as the provided leg covering is not to everyone's taste. Interesting and very VERY busy,1
"I have visited it no.of times and frankly to say within bangalore, there is no such huge temple where one can spend atleast 3-4 hours in a day. I would recommend the Visitor to visit it during non festive day if you are visiting alongwith your family which covers kids and older ones. Except this,if you are visiting alongwith your friends then you can visit on any day. The main sabhagruha of the temple is very big and one can sit for pray in between. One can find beautiful view of bangalore from it as it's on height. Two ways to enter in main sabhagruha: (1) By following usual queue (2) By paying extra fees- VIP entry Apart from this, one can buy different items such as pooja items, photos, frames, key-chains, t-shirts, kurtas, idols etc. of lord Krishna from here. Also, some sweets and food items available. Interesting thing is to speak 103/108 times mantra of lord Krishna. In short, it's worth to see at least once.",1
One of the most beautiful temple of Lord Krishna in the world.,1
Peacefull place.....first place where i visited in bangalore ......,1
Really beautiful place to visit at Iskcon Temple.. Its located on top Hare Krishna Hill's.. Probably I have to bring my parents at ISKCON TEMPLE BANGALORE,1
"The sculptures, structure are all truly reflecting the temple architectural beauty of South India. Devotion is ultimate. Swamy Prabhupada lives here eternally, seeking Lord Krishna's blessings for all His devotees. I would say this is one among the best of ISKCON temples.",1
"Its a privilege to write a review on ISKCON Temple, Bangalore. I had been here for at least 5 times by now. Love this temple a lot. ISKCON is very far from where I am staying, but it is the beauty of the temple which made me visit so many times. The temple is located on a hill and this is clearly visible from the entry gate itself. It is a very big temple. There is a barricade at the entrance of the temple where we must stand in a queue to enter the main gate. From there, we climb up some slope. After climbing, a counter will be there where we have to deposit our mobiles and slippers. Once we do, we move on. Here starts the queue. It is very long, we climb the steps and move on. There is greenery to the left hand side where we go in the queue. Inside the temple, firstly we shall have darshan of ""Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy"". The statutes are built very beautifully. Secondly, darshan of ""Sri Venkateshwara Swamy"" will be done. Again, the beauty of the deity is not to be missed. Finally, we reach the mandir of ""Lord Sri Krishna"" which is on the top. Awesome design, the crowd, the silence, charisma of Lord Sri Krishna will surely attract any tourist. Lord Krishna will appear in 3 screens, the middle one being Radha and Krishna. Whenever I come to ISKCON, I will surely sit and meditate here for at least 15 minutes. Once darshan is done, we move on to shopping arcade. Before that, there is a screen which shows how our soul moves in different bodies (child, adult, married man, old man, etc). There is huge shopping arcade as well as eatery. After shopping, we can find the place where we can have free meals. Also, there is a fountain where we can have a photo shoot or sit for some time and chit chat. We move on to collect our belongings (mobile, slippers) and disperse and REVISIT.",1
"Every time I visit ISKCON temple I feel at peace. It is little uphill which gives very nice view from there. The temple is very clean. We can sit together and do small bhajans inside the temple, I visit the temple very often and always find refreshing. Hare Ram Hare Ram ram Ram Hare Hare. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare",1
"Well maintained, in order and beautiful temple. One of must visit in Bangalore.",1
Daily Mantra....Hare Rama Hare Krishna think of this it was helpful to mind control....,1
Well maintained temple and one of the most popular places in Bangalore,1
Generally hindu temples will be in a dark ( particularly moolavar0 here just like a auditorium the god is placed. GOOD. While returning the devotional sprit has gone while passing the commercial area in the temple itself,0
"Sri Radha Krishna Temple has deities of Radha and Krishna located at Rajajinagar, in North Bangalore,Karnataka,India. I...",1
We had a family visit and enjoyed the Arti and Bhajans! Dinner at the Higher Taste restaurant was just superb!,1
ISKCON temples always sooth you in a way of their own and Banglaore ISKON is no defferent. Its very nice place especially for Krishna's devotees.,1
"This temple is hidden between the residential complex ofrajajinagar We happened to visit this temple by chance. I must say, we were mesmerized by the Lordkrishna idol in the main temple. Also the paintings done inside the temple are very good.Visited July 2014",1
One of the Good & beautiful place in Bangalore once if I entered in pilgrim giving a positive energy & positive taught's to my mind's,1
"The ""Hare Krishna Hare Radha"" chants inside the temple complex along with the beautifully painted interior roofs create a mesmerizing effect on the soul. You can buy a lot of good books and merchandize too here. The food stalls before the exit.",0
"Depending on your belief you will either hate or love this place. Traditionally in India Temples/Mosques do not have ticket systems. The massive crowds in some places of high veneration justify a ticket system . This place does not qualify for the pilgrimage category. The temple is well managed and clean , but fails to impress. Do not go with small kids on weekends and on festival days. i came back having ticked off a local attraction on my list. There's no urge to go back.",0
Nice place..,1
"Look.at the temple art ,it's location and the sense of divinity.chant the name of the Lord n seek blessings. It's a temple of peace..",1
Peace and blessings full temple,1
Nice devotional place to visit,1
Awesome place with a real pilgrimage center feeling. You can spend hours here. Environment is awesome.,1
"Nice place to visit, as it fills your heart with peace and ""no-cell-on"" noises. this place like all other Isckon temples occupies your full 1-2 hours and provides places to buy prashadas.",1
Nice temple to visit,1
This is a nice temple. So neat and clean,1
Weekend crowd.. feels more like a mall than temple.. temple lawn breeze s worth getting in.,1
I visited the ISKCON mandir with a friend and found it very disappointing. The temple was nice but the entire experience was much too commercial. At every step we were being asked to either donate or buy something. The temple was at the top of the structure and to exit you are forced to walk through all the rooms and areas where they are selling merchandise and food. It was akin to going to an IKEA where you have to pass through everything before you can leave. My experience was not very spiritual.,0
How in the world can I forget this place! I love this place a lot. Those days in Bangalore was one of the finest days?,1
A place where everyone can be bold,1
"This place is heaven in Bangalore. clean, Cool,most peaceful, Sublime, very soothing feeling, feel like staying there forever. This place is best for people looking for peace and meaning for LIFE!!!",1
We visited there. every thing was smoothly organised. Best thing was special darshan tkt facility. Taste of food at restaurant canteen were very good. You must visit here during your stay.,1
Very commercial place.,0
A must visit place in Bangalore specially if you practice Hindu religion. Architecture wise it's awesome. And the temple management is doing awesome job in maintaining this.,1
A peaceful place and nature view is naturally designed for holy place where all devotees can forget everything and the state of mind shows happiness in their faces,1
Vast area in the city. More spiritual and must to watch when visiting Bangalore. Very good place to see.,1
Iscon...what ever the temperature outside the temple...inside it is all cool and devoteeship. Hare krishna Hare rama,1

"This is one the best places in Bangalore. Nicely maintained, good facility and perfect ambiance.",1
This place is has great architecture the idol of Krishna is a treat for your eyes. On a hill top krishna temple is like a crown for the bangalore city. Amazing food served as prasadam. One think I did not like is the quick darshan you get for a price.,1
the top view of the temple is very nice and temple architect is awesome. Good to visit during weekend and during Krishan Janmastami.,1
This is not just a temple but a spiritual place where you can be drenched in spirituality in every aspect. The place is well maintained with disciplined entry and exit everywhere.,1
The place is comercialised fully. Not fot the feeling that I am in a temple. Too many shops sells everything and they designed the exit so that u have to go through all the shops and to get out. Parking is a problem. Good thing the main all is calm and crafted nicely.,0
"What a place to visit. The architecture , the ambiance, the hospitality in the temple is simple best. Even thou, it looks like a five star temple,still the by hearing Bhajan's you will get involved and start liking the temple",1
ISKCON temple banglore- where peace of mind is guaranteed..,1
This could be a wonderful place for the tourists who love Lord Krishna.... who represents a free and loving spirit... The cleanliness and the spirit of the place is nicely created and maintained... The food served as prasadam is of high quality.... What's jarring is the visitors being forced to chant hare Rama hare Krishna,0
Temple is beautifully built with the three stories. Gopuram are filled with glass. after finish of the darshan of Krishna if you plan to leave from that place you will taken to the commercial places. for regular visitors it is waste to see all commercials.,1
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare,1
"very nice experience .you can just feel the piece of mind here. lots of food options.no TV, but for comfortable and spiritual stay this is best.",1
the temple is well built and maintained ...and we can take friends from outside India to see it and they loved it ..also offers delicious food,1
A Very Good Place Of Worship On Hill Top With Excellent Place To Spend Few Hours If Not Disturbed By Iskcon Members Regarding Membership Very Good Snacks & Top Quality Veg Food Available Dislike Forced Walking Thru Their Stalls Of books & Food Stalls,0
The glorious morning are refreshment and peace holy spirit in peace ... The sound as the dawn break the thualsi that smells sweet with loving with bless to grace and forgiveness when I was come over for holiday on 2014 .. Next year I wish to be there again with God Grace me ...,1

What a wonderful place. I love the place ..jai shree Krishna,1
Very nice I love to Radhe Kirshna Hari boo Radhe radhe,1
"While this temple is certainly awe-inspiring in scale and grandeur,it is clear to see that it is not part of the original Iskcon I know and love. Commercialism has won here.",0
Beautiful temple situated on top of a hill. We had to walk up several steps to reach the Very quiet and spectacular ambience. We tried the food which was also delicious. Only the souvenir sections are slightly overbearing. We felt intimidated slightly by people there.,1
it was awesome.A very big temple,1
Temples are losing their sanctity. I wish the energies were stronger but this place feels like a modern shopping mall.,1
"Clean, well organized temple. The priests looked educated and treated devotees with respect. Plenty of literature around Lord Krishna and History is available along with eateries and prasadam. Suggest arrive by cab or public transport",1
"The spiritual ambiance is mind blowing.... The best temple I have visited, this is one temple I would suggest everyone to visit...",1
"very nice place, must visit if you are in bangalore.should see the aarti at the evening time. very clean . gives peace of mind",1
The visit was great but there are lots of selling joints inside the temple which should not be there at a spiritual place,0
"The Temple is made beautifully and the presence of God made it more beautiful.The main hall inside is FANTASTIC.I experienced peace inside me while seating inside the hall in-front of Lord Krishna,Balaram,Sri Chaitanya.Useally visitors don't wait till 20.15 hrs because thats the time the evening puja starts(sleeping time for Lord Krishna).All priests and disciples dance and chant Hare Krishna mantra,its a wonderful experience.The food is always good and everything is systematic.",1
the place is really quite and among the best iskcon temples. Everyone should go at least once. The food counters there are amazing and you get khichidi as prasad which was delicious,1
It is one of the best temples to visit in Bangalore the structure is great and management is fantastic,1
"Alongiwth religious, spirituality, place offers a lot for people to come together. can spent half a day with family or friends",1
Very nice,1
"Must visit place in Bangalore. Hare rama hare krishna melody will go on all around and all will be chanting the same. It feels so nice from Heart and Mind. The Temple Architecture is really good. The God Idols and Paintings are awesome and Beautiful. The prasad what you get here is also yummy. You may also like to do some shopping like books, Beeds, Paintings, audios and videos.",1
Built nicely on top of a small hill but surroundings is not good. Extremely crowded and requires lot of walking.,0
"Very Nice New Age temple complex. God , service , Teachings Of Bagavadgita",1
"I went to this place with my parents visiting Bangalore. The temple is well organised and very clean and beautiful. A nice place to visit with your family. They have entry tickets, family/ groups... every one is made to take part in aarti... the temple from inside is very beautiful with all the diyas and lamps lit... I will definitely recommend this place for a visit.",1
Nice place of worship at Bangalore. Good landscape like hill. Great Prasadam food and souvenir shop to get gifts and books.,1
serene atmosphere. visit with family. Nice lighting to watch in the evening and night. Good nicely decorated radha krishna.,1
"ISKCON Temple in Bangalore has beautiful temple architecture, distribute timeless wisdom of Srila Prabhupada as books, conduct thoughtful classes, serve tasty prasadam. They also sell devotional items at temple counters for home use, and provide organic food products to keep our body in healthy condition. Festivals at ISKCON Temple in Bangalore are very lively and are an added attraction. Devotees in ISKCON Bangalore temple answer almost all questions. Now I am a life member of ISKCON Bangalore",1
I didn't like the place.,0
Very very nice temple,1
Nice place to spend in evening,1
"Well nothing to see if you are going to see something, but probably devotees may find something good.",0
"No doubt that it is an amazingly beautiful temple, very clean and organized. However what I did not like the commercialization of the temple. While I was standing in the queue waiting patiently for darshan, a representative approached me and asked if I want to avoid the queue? For all obvious reasons I said ""Yes please"". He showed his identity card and took out a receipt book and asked me to pay either 500/- or 1000/- or more as an offering to the temple. I refused and came back to the queue",1
"Security checking can be a little irritating after which you will invoke God, for the opportunity He has provided you to visualise the city of Bangalore from top, the golden Krishnna.

Nice temple,1

Great temple and Bangalore's landmark. You'll get variety of foods as well.,1

"Very clean area, visiting places",1
"beautiful place,very surprised for a first time.but very crowdy and have little time to pray.but they have done it such a way for prayers own security.",0
Liked the mind blowing infra and design of the temple. Also very organised and always ready place to accommodate a large crowd. Overall experience was good. But found it too much commercialized. Hare Krishna!,1

"Well maintained temple with organised parking, food, queue, darshan. Best time is to reach by aarti time to enjoy the religious hyms.",1
One of the Best Establishment from Iskon around various part of India. This Iconic Temple dedicated to lord sri Krishna. Evening aarati is a special mention which provides peace of mind with a midas touch to Soul. A must in Bangalore with highly maintained Temple.,1
Krishna is awesome that's it?,1
Really a superb place...,1
Nice temple to visit in Bangalore ! Very organised and controlled queue management makes visit a pleasure. Nearby metro station is an added advantage for stress free transport !! :-),1

"got a very nice experience in this place, worth to visit this place for a while. it is famous radha krishna temple",1
"Beautiful structure, Serene amongst the bhajans. The Lord adorns this beautiful temple amidst all the grandeur and fervor of his bhakts. A must visit for those who wish to experience the power of human positivity. Additionally, loads of souvenirs, books, incense sticks and artifacts for the shopaholics and excellent vegetarian food (both budget and high end) for the hungry.",1
"One of the famous temple in Bangalore. On weekends n festival times the temple will be crowd, good maintenance and well ...",1
This is very important temple in Bangalore,1
"We visited on a Saturday afternoon, so it was quite crowded. The main entrance to the temple is free, but they will try to heavily sell you on a VIP ticket that lets you bypass the lines. We opted for the free entrance and didn't have too much wait. Be prepared to have the correct attire...no shorts allowed. They will give you appropriate cover up if you do wear shorts, with the appropriate deposit. The main temple is quite ornate with the golden alter, and many devotees sitting on the floor in the middle of the temple reciting the Hare Krishna mantra. Once you exit the main temple, you will enter the highly commercialize maze of marketplace stalls and food vending...seeming endless at times. You'll exit the temple with a handout of a free bowl of hot food, which was actually quite tasty. Aside from the loudspeakers on a continuous loop of the mantra, it was an overall interesting experience in Indian culture...but clearly a money making site for the Hare Krishna.",0
Its a nice place,1
"Place is calm takes your mind off everything, and food court serves awesome delicacy Great place overall",1
Hare ram..,1
"I've never been to a temple until ISKCON. What an amazing place to visit. The lines can get very long, you need to remove your shoes (I wore socks), and you can't take any cameras in. You will have to go through security so don't try to sneak a camera in...they will make you check it in so just leave in your car if you can. Beautiful place though and well worth it to go. Visited October 2014",1
I really like...... radha Krishna temple is so beautiful OSM .....!!,1
"The temple is beautifully made. The height at which it is, offers a beautiful view and breeze. One feels peaceful. What I didnt like is that it has a lot of commercial element. On the way out, one has to pass through so many stalls. Even if one doesnt want to buy anything, you have to take the same route.",1
"The temple is peaceful, well-maintained and clean, as long as you don't visit on religious holidays. If you are looking to visit on Janmashtami, absolutely avoid, unless you are a devotee.",0
I visit this place very often. I like the temple very much. If your want spiritual please visit this place.,1
Been there once during some festival. Its a grand temple with beautiful architecture. Had discussion with the monks or priest there was good but they were almost trying to force us to attend their weekend camp. this was very bad experience. Food court there is awsome and full of tasty items specially samosa was delicious.,0
"I like the serenity and solitude over there. I was there in the evening and was there with my baby. she also enjoyed the visit to the ikon temple,",1
Nice temple to visit for experiencing the culture,1
"We visited on Wednesday with family and it was great place. Beautiful, reach, managed place for dev darshan. When you come down after darshan there are many shops for food, refreshments, handicrafts and show item. Food quality is v good clean and testy. No one ask for donations, do where it needed.",1
Very nice place !!!!,1
"Must visit to see the architecture of the building. Please visit over weekdays, weekend it's too crowded, do try the laddoos.",1
"Neatly maintained and organised temple, must visit for everyone in bangalore , located in heart of city so commute is easy",1
"Hare Rama, Hare Krishna this melody will go to your ear & mind as you enter the premises, its very nicely managed & clean. you have to stand in a que to get Darshan, when you enter the temple you will get relaxed & forget all the tensions, you can sit for a while & enjoy the relax environment.",1
what you like over there is the peace. i was sitting there for almost 2 hours and i could sense the positive energy popping out from inside. I believe in God but not often to temples. but when i went here i could feel the stress release which i think was happened due to the soothing environment over there,1
Its a clean and beautiful place. They have a separate section where you can place your footwear and after that you,1
Second visit. Typical corporate setup to make sure you spend more time in counters than in dharsan. Whatever they sell also mostly not so good food and pricey. Really not good for old people as they make you to go through all the counters by blocking all straight paths to make it like noodle path.,0
Very well maintained and managed. Went there early in the morning and the place was quite empty. Had a very pleasant ...,1
Good infrastructure,1
Awesome temple world wide it should be no 1,1
"This temple is a must see in Bangalore. If you are interested in Indian religions, the Iskcon Temple is a magic experience in the Krishna cult.",1
wonderful temple..... :),1
Iskon temple is the place I feel to go when I need peace of mind because this place is so calm full chanting of Lord krishna I feel blessed by Lord krishna when i'm with my partner we both love this place,1
ISKCON Sri Radha Krishna is a really good place with a great sculpture work. This temple covers a very large area. It reminds us about the stories of Lord Krishna. The devotional bhajans and prayers gave us a different experience. And this premises has got such a large prasad area. Had a very good time with family.,1
Fantastic place,1
"I enjoyes spending time in iskon, Since the bhajan will be too good, we will get peace of mind, Person willing peace of mind can go and hear the bhajan and enjoy",1
"ISKCON temple is a must visit place for a religious person in Bangalore. The temple is always well organised. I have visited it a couple of times on New Years as well and the crowd was well managed. The Radhe Krishna, Krishna & Balarama and the Chaitanya Mahaprabhu idols are beautifully decorated. Overall the place gives a sense of peace.",1
But it is commercial .everything is about to earn money,1
This is a temple as if as the temples we see abroad. They are clean and neat. Well maintained and well organised temple. The deities are made of marble and are too good to see.,1
"The temple is very beautiful from outside as well as from inside. The idols of deities are equally magnificent. From the first stairs of the temple till the deities, the feeling was very spiritual. But even before you exit the main hall/darbar, you can see the shops in abundance. Then you are forced to go through at least two floors of huge ""SHOPPING COMPLEX"" before you come out of the temple. We went there thinking of a temple and we came out with utter dis-satisfaction after seeing the huge commercial activity inside the temple. If you are planning to visit a ""TEMPLE"", then please try to avoid ISKCON Bangalore..",0
five star for the soothing music that they play in the hall.,1
Visit early morning for aarti before the gates are opened infront of the idols. It feels like heaven,1
"It's a nice experience from entry to exit. Sankalp concept was good. The entire environment ,decor /ambiance are quite beautiful . It's a place for peace seeking people. Prasadam snacks counters are also good . Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna..krishna Krishna hare..hare... Hare rama hare Krishna.",1
very disciplined and systematic darshan! Prasad is great! This place also has pure vegetarian restaurant where the food is awesome.,1
Surreal experience ..... This is the first time I visited ISKCON Temple. Coincidentally it was also the start of Deepotsava. My friends Vinod and Revanth also participated in the commemoration of Deepotsava. So I shared a mind blowing and blessed experience in the temple. Feeling Blessed being part of it.,1
Wonderfully,1
Religious place Definitely brings the inner peace,1
nice shrine..pleasant and soothing atmosphere..the entry ritual is a nice one..reading the scroll and stepping on the stones.very nice..the main temple is good.the variety of things to buy is more ..in the lower levels..then the food level..a lot of nice dishes and sweets available. just find a place sit complete the food .use the garbage cans.. use ola for to and fro journey.. pictures inside are prohibited..but u can take pictures just after food near the small artificial pond. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r290721585-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#,1
Great place..it's really one of the main attraction center of Bangalore city..,1

Cheating and making money in name of god,0
Awesome,1
Vaikunta descended on earth Hare krishna !!,1
"Have been to the place twice. And loved it. Calm, knowledgeable and Spiritual centeric. The biggest iskon in the world.",1
ISKCON is really a wonderfull place to visit .Not only to the devotees of Lord Krishna it is a place of visit to every one as ISKCON is full of beautiful locations. If you are a devotee of Lord Krishna it looks like a paradise.,1
One of the best ISKCON temples I have been to .. Very nice ambience .. Situated near Orion mall ..,1
A place in Bangalore where you will get recharged/ Refreshed after your hectic work schedule. A calm & holy environment which will refresh your mind and sole for sure.,1
Staff needs to be more sensitive. Old people have to climb stairs in absence of proper information about lift.,1
Beautiful,1
Hare Krishna! Must visit in Bangalore.,1
"Temple is good. Nice architecture. But place is not so enchanting, no vibes. This is a temple for tourist not for devotees. After the darshana, you need to pass through the mall of god. Lots of shops selling gods and god related stuffs",0
Good place to visit in Bangalore...,1
Best place for workship,1
"Iskcon temple is one of most iconic and structure is like hill and well maintained, good state of mind and pure atmosphere.",1
Nice place to have prasadam,1
Better place to get peace of mind. Better place to get peace of mind. Better place to get peace of mind.,1
"Neat clean temple. Not very long waiting line. Should go from tile area where you can chant ""hare rama, hare krishna"". Below temple there is one shopping mall, but now they have given an option to skip it. Nice and cheap restaurant.",1
"More of commercialized place and less of a temple. They have designed darshanam path in a way where you get darshanam in 10 mins but after that you will keep rotating between their market for half an hour where you will get almost everything like food, religious books, appears etc.",0
It was overal a good experince visiting bangalore with beautiful locations nearby . visited lalbag and had a fast moving day,1
"went there with my parent in january this year. A nice place to have peace of mind. Starts with a queue to hand the slippers. Pay 100 to get a bucket of puja samaghri. Get into the temple. You should try the steps way to get into the temple and on each step you have to chant the words written in the paper they give you. Sit inside for a while, collect prasad and while coming out you can have food, different decorating material, gods statues and clothes. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r301072489-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
great place,1

Jai shreekrishna,1
Surely not a temple of utmost devotional flavour ... Highly disappointed ... The temple concentrates more on their shopping area than on the devotional area ...,0
"If you believe in lord Krishna then a must visit the place, the chanting and festive seasons are really mesmerising. I just don't like the commercialization part of the temple. But I avoid that and enjoy the rest.",1
big temple .Lord Radha Krishna super . lighting is good .feeling good in this temple . good food available in temple.,1

"Peaceful, silent and calm are the feelings you will get when you hit here! I love this place anytime!",1
Gud,1
Iskcon nice temple,1
"The idols of Radha and Krishna are very beautiful and so are the paintings on the ceiling of the sanctum. If you are lucky, you can sit a bit and meditate. However, one does get a bit hungry after standing in the long line (an orderly line, but long) for darshan. There's great spread of food as soon as step out after darshan and the food is reasonably priced. Everything tastes great: lemon rice, malpua, pakodas. Yum! My favorite is the eggless wheat and jaggery cake. It is divine. There's also a restaurant within the campus and the price in the al-a-carte menu are quite reasonable. If you choose to attack the buffet spread, ensure you have a big stomach and deep pockets. The buffet offers many dishes but it also comes at a steep price.",1
God for poor children's for mid day meal in Bangalore,1
Go here to spend a quiet afternoon.,1
Very beautiful interiors of the temple. The food they serve here is authentic indian vegetarian. Expect long queues on all days especially hindu festivals such as ugadi,1
"Very well constructed temple and well organized to handle crowd. Its become too commercial since everywhere in the temple complex, you will find something or other being sold.",1
Best ISKON temple,1
It is not a temple in the strictest term as the atmosphere of an Hindu temple is missing. It is more a picnic spot Visited May 2014,0
Biggest temple in Bangalore to see. You can eat and shop inside a small area of temple but cost is high,1
Very clean and calm place,1
Lovely place enjoyed lot,1
"Very Nice New Age temple complex. God ,food to school's , Teachings Of Bagavadgita",1
Peace and Bliss...personified...my sweet pleasant memories with Appa in Iskcon...A trip down memory lane.,1

Its holy temple. Very peaceful place for worshiping lord Krishna. Avoid weekends as the place will be crowded.,1
"The temple of Iskcon are always nice to visit and chanting of Hare Krsna is worth hearing in your ears. They shall restrict food areas, which is a real mess.",1
"I have been here on numerous occasions, compelled by my family who are the regular devotees here, this temple is indeed beautiful, Huge and certainly well done, however the biggest let down is that this is institution is a might commercial model, its always over crowded and it will take hours before you get to the sanctum. *** This is my personal opinion, *** i don't intent to hurt anyone's feeling. I write this though i am ardent devotee myself, the only thing that i cant connect to is where people pay and get the vip easy access / darshan, this is not something i can connect to. but that said, my salute to the cause of Akshaya patra, this is very well conducted.",0
This was amazing experience. I went to temple early morning and saw the first arti at temple. Experience was excellent!,1
A tourist attraction.,1
Feeling Divine,1
It's wonderful temple.it's providing food facilities to many school childrens.it. encourag cultural activitys.,1
"Amazing place to be!!! Very calm and peaceful,But i do find almost every way of business here, though at one point it came across to me that God is commodity now. Though i also came to know that all the revenue generated through these small kiosks inside the temple will be utilized on poor sections of society, after that i don't mind even if god is commodity here!!!",1
"I¬¥ve seen a billion temples in India, and I¬¥m honestly getting a little tired of it. It¬¥s all the same.. Except for Iskcon - I¬¥ve actually been here several times, and I enjoy it every time. It¬¥s very beautiful and you can not help being humbled by the greatness of this. Definetly worth a visit Visited July 2014",1
Nice place...reminds me the ISKCON temple at Mayapur,1
"If you are in Bangalore, never miss the opportunity to visit the ISKCON temple. Though I have always opted for the VIP passes, am sure the normal visit is as peaceful and smooth as the VIP. The moment you enter this place, you will get the positive vibrations and feel as if you have entered a different world. The idols of Sri Krishna in different avatars is mesmerizing and would stay with you for a long time. Chanting Hare-Krishna-Hare-Krishna-Krishna-Krishna-Hare-Hare eases every stress and brings you closer to bhagwan Krishna _/\_",1
"I have always hated the religious places with too much of commercial fervor. And this place top the all, its nothing but a giant shopping complex in the shape of a temple! Oh Lord Krishna, please forgive me.",0
Good place. Very calm and it's a must place to visit in Bengaluru. You will definitely love this place,1

"operating with a handful of devotees Under the leadership of the Temple President, Sri Madhu Pandit Dasa, consisting of guest house, kalian mantap, donor care, deity and pooja, devotional artefacts, In the holy town of Vrindavana, the festival of Jhulan Utsava lasts for 13 days. It starts on the third day (tritiya) of the bright fortnight of shravana (July-Aug) and lasts until the full moon night of the month. During this festival the Radha-Krishna Deities in the temples are gently swayed on a swing. I have visited recently and they provided me a Book of lord Krishna free of cost with prasadam at the end and lot of opportunity to shop while entry and exit. One must visit this wonderful place in Bangalore. NOTE: PHOTOGRAPHY PROHIBITTED",1
best place to get serenity and inner peace in d busy life of bangalore. love the prasad there. i felt like staying there for hours together.....,1
Visited this temple a long ago. When you enter the gate and start walking you will listen chants of Lord Krishna. Aft...,1
"The place is so spiritual. Once you enter you can feel it. I went with my dad and bro. We had a nice experience. For person coming to Bangalore first time, it is a must go place.",1
"Last time when I visited Bangalore decades ago, ISKCON temple was not there. This time when I visit Bengaluru, Bengaluru has several gems in its crown and ISKCON temple indeed deserves a central attention place. It's an admirably treat for eyes for devotees and tourists alike. Beautifully crafted architecture and design, craftsmanship, Grand Idols of RadhaKrishna & ors. Maybe you have seen lots of other ISKCON temples in other parts of India and probably all appear same. Even then if you are in Bengaluru, don't miss ISKCON. Give it one hour minimum, if you can. Krishna is going to be a nice experience and feel. Please Don't opt for special Darshanam. Move as a common simple man and enjoy Krishna's Consciousness in everyone you see, then, may be for a split second, you may feel it is Krishna Consciousness in you too. In case you want to offer any puja etc then you may buy the same at prescribed counter by tendering prescribed amount and obtain a receipt. Besides devotional feature, equal emphasis is on Marketing feature. You can Sell God in India. Incredible India it is. May be our great seers like Swami Prabhupad or Acharya Rajneesh never even wildly imagined in their life times that they themselves are Saint Peter of Today's Vatican. But one thing whatsoever they sell, let it be books, audio, idols, souvenirs, every piece is beautifully crafted and produced. You will not regret for quality of products. There is a free kitchen besides other selling points for a variety of delicacies of India. The kitchen provides free food to whosoever comes to eat and trust me the food is simply delicious. Here in this complex, I fear one of the big shortcoming is parking. Lots and lots of tourists visit and parking space for vehicles is going to be a big issue, if not attended in time. Worth a Chant "" krsna krsna hare hare "".",1
Very big temple with pleasant atmosphere Most important in this temple is Krishna chanting is all over the place It helps to relax our mind and body And the prasadams are available in downstairs you should not miss that,1
"The temple is bigger than Mumbai Iskcon and thankfully has plenty of paid parking space available. Temple is very clean and the evening Aarti would be a great treat for all Krishna followers. Plenty of eating options available to choose from. All in all, a nice place to visit with family",1
"Looking for peace in IT City, this is the right place. Very neat and clean. Architecture is magnificent. Prefer to go early morning.",1
Very well organised complex. Housekeeping is excellent. We bought special Darshana for the family @ 300/=. This made us to cut the queue and near access to the god. This also enabled Prasadam and concession on books . Bought Bhagavadgeeta . The organic food items by their in house dairy are excellent. The eggless backers items which are offered to god are available on sale. The main temple architecture is very good and we had a peaceful time during our visit Less,1
Nice temple with well built campus and one of the busy temple....,1
Nice,1
Peaceful place,1
"It is a serene place with discipline, cleanliness as the main attraction. A important ritual is to step on 108 steps and chant hare ram hare krishna loudly and reach the temple sanctorum... is again an amazing experience.The food or prasad available inside the temple premises is good.. but the temple prasad which is given for free is amazing and fulfilling....The positive energy is contagious.",1
Nice temple & nice ambience. Of the very few places in Bangalore to visit this shall be the best. Good places in and around so u can see many places around.,1
Jai Shri Krishna... Very nice place and pleasant ambience...,1
"Very orderly system and we could worship peacefully in a clean, pious and serene atmosphere and surroundings.",1
"it was a very nice trip, Temple is just awesome. i would recommend if any one is coming to Bangalore plz visit.",1
"This temple is situated in West of chord road near Yeshwanthapur and is maintained by ISKCON ,FULL OF MARBLE FLOORING AND IDOLS OF MARBLE in the temple situated in a hilly height . The cars are plying right upto to the foot of the small hill top temple. Neat and clean to international standard ,the worshippers are visiting throughout the year and this is one of the regular visits by residents,tourists of Indian and International origin.

Food is freely served during Lunch and prashadams (snacks of temple ) is available on purchase. Preferable to go before 11am and visit after 5 pm till 8 30 pm. It seems that The temple closes by 12 noon for four hours",1
please note temple will be closed in this timings 1pm to 4pm,1
"Cool place to see, had no clue what to do inside but everyone seemed welcoming. Great place to experience culture.",1
"Its a neatly maintained shopping mall labelled as a ""temple"". From the point you enter the so called ""temple"" till you exit it, it is lined with food courts and shops. So if you want to show off a ""temple"" to friend from outside India, then go for it. Its shining bright and commercial as it gets. If you want spirituality and peace, well, this is definitely not the place. The question to the ISKCON folks who bother to answer poor reviews on this site: Why are there shops and eateries BEFORE entering the sanctum? Shouldn't the purpose of devotees be ""darshan"" first and the rest only later? What is the point in preaching ""detachment"" and the ""world is maya"" when the queue before reaching sanctum has so many distractions? Do you even understand the fundamentals of spirituality? Or is it that money-money-money matters so much that the rest matters lesser? http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r269916283-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",0
"You can visit the temple, to see the architecture and all. its a marvel. Usually parking should not be a problem, esp on weekdays. But on weekends It can be a problem, esp whenever festivals are there. You might end up waiting for parking itself. There is a nominal fee for parking. The place can get very crowded during festival days. elders and people with health issues will find it difficult, as they will have to walk for sometime and will need to climb up some steps to get to the main temple.They do have some provision to reduce the number of steps, but cannot avoid that in entirety. The normal entrance is through a small room where you have 108 steps, and you chant ""Hare Rama hare Krishna krishna krishna hare hare"" as you make each step. The main temple have deities of Radha and Krishna. The sanctum sanctorum and deities are covered in gold. There will be always people who will be performing bhajans with musical instruments and you can sit there for some time. The place is highly commercialized, with lots of shops selling souvenirs, photos, vanity items etc...There are many eateries selling snacks and soft drinks. there is a Jain restaurant outside which serves Jain friendly food. The temple gives prasadam (usually khichdi) to every devotee who visits. You can also buy laddoos and other sweets as Prasadm. In all, you can visit the place when you are in Bangalore, but remember about the crowd during festival timings. suggested to go on a weekday to avoid rush. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r287031228-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
"Nice and popular temple in Bangalore. If you are visit Bangalore at the first time, it's the first place I would recommend",1
"Very Nice place to visit with family,Really you love the mantra Jap - Hare Krishna Hare Krishna,Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama ,Rama Rama Hare Hare , On 108 stone steps . enjoyed full day here pure veg food , Devotional books and things related to Lord Krishna Available everything here.",1
"Its one of the biggest Krishna temple in Bangalore. There are 2 other temples Venkateshwara temple and Narasimha Temple inside the same premises. The best thing one would enjoy is the Harinaam Dwar where devotees will chant the mantra Hare Rama Hare Krishna and will reach to the temple. Kids will enjoy the multiplex which hosts movies on Lord Krishna. Good eat out options available inside the temple, I personally liked the samosha. paid parking available inside temple premises. Cameras not allowed inside the temple. The best time to visit the Deepotsav during Diwali festival. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r315100688-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
"A well maintained,clean,calm place to visit.Being there you feel very different and relaxed.Crowd management is also very good.Eateries are too good.Many more things to explore there so in short a very nice place to visit with Family & Friends.",1
"Amazing Temple !!! Beautiful Idols, Very Peaceful, Excellent Marble Works, Must Visit, if you are Bangalore",1
"Very pleasant and elegant, your consciousness simply raises beyond in presence of Radha Krishna Idols there. Superb initiative is Akshaya Patra and unlimited Prasad. You can take Prasad as many times as you wish. Lovely pongal. Took 3 times.",1
"Situated on a hill overlooking the western part of Bangalore, the ISKCON Temple is a must visit for all tourists and residents alike. Having beautiful idols inside, this temple is a wonderful place to visit for the entire family. Visitors please note that the Temple is open for specific timings and is closed in the afternoons.",1
"Visited this temple with my family. Its a Radhaji & Krishna temple. The place is neat, clean and beautiful. It's among the best ISKCON temples. Everyone should go at least once when you are in Bangalore.",1
The temple is indeed built well and attracts tourists. But its more commercialized. There will be no feeling of temple when entered.,0
A well maintained temple A prasadam complex which also sells Pooja & prasadam of the lord .. It has everything inside for a priligrim .... An 3 star hotel a staying place for outside tourists also a membership which offers life time visit & Archana on a fixed day It also promotes mid day meal for govt schools Some feel it is more a shopping complex but this is how a private funded temple looks,1
"The temple is clean and the altitude of the Hare Krishna hill ensures that the temple is clear of traffic noise, making the temple ideal for a calm mind. But the commercial activities in the temple are something that could have been avoided to some extent. You can see pretty much everything on sale: religious books, Personality development classes, tickets for 3D movie on Krishna, organic food, t-shirts, decoratives, all varieties of food etc. lthough everything is being done for a noble cause: ""AKSHAYA PATRA - mid day meal for school children"", these activities come in the way of mental tranquility inside the temple. Overall a rejuvenating experience.",1
"If you want to feel inner peace must visit. Along with that even you can see beautiful temple, nice paintings on roof, even shop and have nice food.",1
The ISKCON temple is a beautiful temple in a city that has many beautiful places to worship in. Situated on the top of a hill you get there by climbing up the steps from the street. The facility is also super friendly to people with limited access - they have wheel chairs and ramps and will also take pains to ensure that people in wheel chairs get a good darshan. There are several eating places on onsite all of which are clean and offer pure vegetarian food.,1
"ISCKON temples are usually about beautiful idols and great prasad to enjoy... This is no different. Located close to the city, and well known... one can easily visit the place without spending too much time. having seen ISCKON temples in various cities, i can say this is one of the good ones",1
Ambiance is very nice. You will find great peace and even can do meditation.,1
"Super ""Management system is nice.., each time we visit our temple .,We enjoy bhajans and kirtans very much........ Lord's and radharani's idols, ornaments and decoration are very much attractive and beautiful...",1
I been to this temple twice . Good temple and nice to go with family and friends. I am sure this will get you peace.,1
One of the Famous Temple in banglore which is located in Rajaji Nagar,1
"I reached temple after a long travel , first thing i liked is sight of the temple , keerthanas and bhakan were going on when i went there , but it would take atleast 30 minutes if you once enter the temple",1
Very big and attractive temple situated on hill.near yashwantpur railway station.very peaceful place.,1
"This is most probably the most beautiful ISKCON temple in India. The motifs of the walls are lovely and so is the architecture and landscaping. The prasadam is delectable and you can purchase a lot of Krishna related stuff like t-shirts, DVDs, decorative items, books, paintings, puja items etc. They have a food court too where you can buy satvik food items that are also tasty. ISKCON also runs programs that you can participate in. Sometimes, it feels like a theme based mall but if worship is not the only thing on your mind then this place is worth a visit. Avoid weekends and festivals as there is a huge rush.",1
The temple visit will be a memorable experience even if you are not much religious person. It's pretty well maintained with a nice architecture . Try to visit during the aarti time during evening. After your visit is over donot forget to check out the books /souvenir and food section .,1
"Pretty much a large version of a typical Hindu temple. If you're the praying type, you might like it, if not, go elsewhere.",0
Really I feel very happy thank you very much iskcon,1
Iskon Temple Bangalore is must to see and very beautiful. For senior citizens you can avail temple provided facility i.e. auto facility for reaching temple and can use lift to reach main temple at 3rd floor,1
Peaceful..the best place to visit...jai shree Krishna,1
100 percent perfect temple and positive environment. I love it,1
Well maintained temple. Visit this place for a pleasant experience. Note the timings carefully before planning to vis...,1
"Beautiful building, peace at everywhere. Quite spot in the busy city, you can sit aside to meditate. Don't like that you can not walk freely, you have to follow a cordon all the time and you can not take photos anytime of anything you want to.",1
Wow! What an amazing Temple. you're allowed to get involved in the whole ceremony and enjoy the beautiful colours and different rooms. A must see for Culture!,1
A visit to this place will purify one from all the stress. This is on a hill and is accessible through simple large steps. Temple is beautiful from inside and outside.,1
It was nice to visit the temple at 7 am morning with no queue hurdles. Good to have devotional ambience..................,1
"Best place to go for an evening, eyes will be filled with beauty of Special evening Aarathi. U can catch a metro from mantri square for a quick ride, traffic free.",1
Its not a temple. It is more like a shopping complex. No Peace.,0
We visited ISCON temple in eve of 20th Sept 2016. The temple has ample parking space and is on a small hill and hence might require climbing if not in a car. Parking ticket is Rs 30. The temple is well maintained and quiet. Please bear in mind that sleeveless tops and shorts or 3/4ths are not allowed for both men and women. But if you happen to be in wrong attire they would provide dhoti to wrap around for Rs 20 which is non refundable and a refundable deposit of Rs 500 per piece. After the Darshan the exit takes you through the shop and canteen where you can buy food items prepared in the temple. The food is very good especially Mallpoa and should be tried.,1
"I was escorted to the ISKCON temple by an Indian colleague while visiting Bangalore in July on business. To my eyes, this was an awe-inspiring place and to be honest quiet humbling. During my visit I seemed to be the only Christian westerner amongst a mass of Hindi Pilgrims and lots and lots of VERY smart schoolchildren, obviously taking a visit during term time ? these children seemed to take a great interest in me and were very polite and embraced the opportunity to speak to a guy from England - both, they and their parents and teachers should be proud of them. Its a very peaceful place and I even queued and did the 108 stepping stones with people chanting Hare rama Hare Krishna in each step. Once inside, it was again a beautiful place and the solid gold alter was adorned with flowers. As I say a very humbling experience. On exit - there is a large outlet selling souvenirs, a snack bar and restaurant. I was so pleased to be able to visit this great attraction and advise anyone from the UK or USA to do the same. Visited July 2014",1
Nice temple Peaceful environment,1
Good place if you are religious.,0
I've never seen or experienced anything like it! Amazing. It is one of the most beautiful temples I've ever seen.,1
Forget about the posh look... temples are not for that. Its really sad that now a days we are not following Agama Sha...,0
Lots of positive energy And very peaceful place God is great,1
It was heavy rush when went on jan 1st.Crowd is not streamlined and no specific queue. Difficult to manage small children. Also the prasadam counter area is not clean will food spilled on the floor etc.,0
Who puts temple in a shopping mall?,0
Discipline at every step makes this temple unique from others. They make you chant the krishna mantra which you will start repeating it without your consciousness and I guess thats when you feel the Krishna Consciousness. Cleanliness is seen every where in the temple which takes it close to godliness. The view of god from the big doors makes you feel the darshan realistic and decoration of the idol is beyond words. Avoid visiting on holidays and festivals and plan to visit in the evening so that you can see it when it lights up to make the experience more beautiful.,1
Temple is still under construction. Location is beautiful and the Narasimha idol which has been installed is marvellous!,1
Ever seen biggest iskon temple.,1
A nice place to visit in Bangalore . Beautiful Temple with peaceful and devotional atmosphere.,1
Excellent place great environment with Lord Krishna chanting awesome,1

"Its been few years that i went to ISKON Temple in bangalore.It was on my way to Art of living ashram i took a break to have a view and feel of ISKON temple at bangalore. I had visited Delhi temple before that. The beauty of the temple is mesmerising.Even more was the paintings of Krishna which is for sale, soul searching beauty in those different bhavas of Krishan,only someone who is so devoted to Krishna can feel it and bring that beauty out.Thats the beauty of the temple. We had taken a cab to that place from my aunts place at Indira nagar. Its slightly far from there ,but reached fast as it was morning time.you can relax take a walk temple,walk up,after darshan,there might be bhajans and dance,vast area,you can meditate.see the books and temple around.go to the shops at the ground floor,with t- shirts of krishna, paintings ,food which is very tasty and offered in a healthy dry bark plate as prasad.every body can enter.anything can be worn, better to be neatly dressed.you can buy bhajans,should select as some might not be of your taste.Madhurashtakam was one of the best i heard from there.u can spend some quiet time alone or with family.shouldn't miss the painting.You can join the charity work they do also. Take a look inside and find what you are searching for....",1
Silence,1
This was our first visit to an ISKCON temple. The experience was soul thrilling and recommend others to attend the early morning prayers. We attended all the three prayers one after another in all three temples and were lucky enough to attend the Sh Narsimha bhagwan Abhishake. The temple is situated on top of a little hillock and is very beautifully built.,1
"An awesome place for devotees,peaceful and calmness place.",1
Nice temple to to take Darshana of Lord krishna,1
"The temple is clean, managed and beautifully commercialised. While your decent from the main chamber, you'll come across book stalls, memoir stalls, apparel, sweets and things you never thought would be sold in the brand of krishna.. Oh My God.",0
"I visited the Temple for a numbers of time. Always feel good. The atmosphere is little-bit crowded but pleasure to visit. In the early morning, the atmosphere is quite different and really gives a different feeling. I like and love the place. There is a guest house facility for the family who wishes to stay by paying a small donation. But those who are Life Members, may stay up to three nights in free of cost. Some one, interested, may try and test. Mr. Chatterjee, Manager/Receptionist of the Guest House is very helpful and friendly. He is ready to help and doing his best for the guests.",1
Place of spirituality,1
"I liked the temple's peace & quite but while coming out of the temple, I felt it is too commercialized.",1
"This is a popular place and people from other places like to visit the Temple. The ""Akhyaya Patra"" scheme of ISKCON is world famous. They provide mid day meals to a large number of schools around Bangalore. ""Higher Taste"" in ISKCON campus is by far the best vegetarian (no onion, no garlic to boot) restaurant in Bangalore. I have visited with family & friends many times for buffet lunch and find the food very satisfying. Highly recommended.",0
"This is a very nice temple to visit. Nice architecture and beautiful inside. But, it was incredibly crowded and you have to queue and trudge round in long lines with no chance to stop and take in what you are looking at. Maybe I was unlucky on timing, but it was heaving. Two tips: 1. You cannot take a camera...",0
"ISKCON temple of Radha-Krishna is one of the iconic places of Bangalore. Located in Rajajinagar; this temple of ISKCON is one of the largest of ISKCON temples in the world. The temple complex is huge and is built atop a mountain full of boulders. The architects of this temple complex used the land beautifully to create a Brindavan like ambiance. Sri. Madhu Pandit Dasa, one of the desciples of HDG A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, after his wishes conceived this project and built it. The temple has a gold-plated dhwaja-stambha (flag post) 17 m (56 ft) high, with a gold plated kalash shikara 8.5 m (28 ft) high.It has six shrines, main shrine is of Radha-Krishna.Krishna Balrama; Nitai Gauranga (Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda); Srinivasa Govinda ( also known as Venkateswara ).Prahlada Narasimha; Srila Prabhupada. The temple is open from 4:15 am to 5:00 am. The day begins with a Maha(Grand) Aarati ceremony called Maha Mangalarati followed by worship of Tulasi Devi, Sri Narasimha Aarati and Suprabhata Seva for Sri Srinivasa Govinda(Lord Balaji). After a recess the temple opens at 7:15 am for Shringara Darshana Arati; it remains open till 1:00 pm before it closes for the afternoon. In the evening it opens at 4:15 pm and remains open till 8:15 pm. During Festivals, weekends and public holidays the Temple opens between 4:15 am to 5:00 am; 7:00 am to 8:30 pm without any recess in the afternoon. The evening Mahamangalarati starts at 7:00 pm when devotees sing Bhajan & kirtan while devoties dance to the tune and rythm of ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"". Prasadam is distributed free to visiting devotes during darshan hours.",1
"Once you are inside after security check up and keeping your shoes (Rs 2) it is very peaceful. First layer Narashima temple, 2nd layer, Tirupathi Srinivasa temple, finally Lord Krishna. Don't miss 108 steps for chanting Hare Krishna, also don't miss 7 PM arathi. There is free lunch if you are between 12 Noon and 3 Pm. Collect your free Prasad on the way out, along with photo of Lord Krishna in the language you want. Must visit",1
"When you want to get away for a few hours from the busy life and busier traffic of Bengaluru, ISKCON is a beautiful place to go. It is not like any other temple. This temple provides you with fresh cool air and peace to that extent that your soul will be transformed and you will be energetic. Access is easy to this place as it located well within the city.",1
"Awesome temple & best silent environment for all peoples ,we will get peace & enjoyment+motivation lot.",1
You get peace of mind when you visit this temple and sit inside or within the premises of temple. Very clean and nice...,1
Good,1
"Very good temple to visit but, too much crowd during weekends. Very well maintained. I didn't like the way temple is forcing the devotee queue towards their resturant. It looks more like commercialing the ISKCON brand.",0
Had visited this on a business trip . The architecture is very good and the place is well maintained / near and clean,1
"Iskon temples have always aced in architectural beauty and their devoted nature either towards GOD or to their members/visitors. This is clearly evident in this temple also. Very efficiently organised and maintained. Temple interiors are beautiful and God idols are mesmerizing. But as soon as you leave the main temple towards the exit area, there begins a series of stalls either for eateries or spiritual books/items. You can buy Bhagvat Gita in nearly all the languages. You can get even small items like pins, bags, posters, idols costing rs.10-15 to the big posters, metallic decorative items, big decorative idols costing thousands of rupees. There canteen is also vast and has a variety of affordable tasty edible items. You can also get CDs with animated Krishna stories for your children. At last, there are Prasad stalls, which provide free prasad. It is very nice to see some organisations so much devoted to GOD and in spreading their preachings/learnings, but its equally confusing to analyse that they are only made available to people who can pay for them.",1
"Must visit ,nice place",1
The Look of the Temple is Nice & Beautiful. Always Pepole Crowded Area,1
"""Management system is nice.., each time we visit our temple .,We enjoy bhajans and kirtans very much........

I have been to ISKCON temple multiple times and it always sties me how well maintained the place is.

Of late I also attended a couple of family functions there and was pleasantly surprised by the arrangements and staff there.,1

This temple is a modern and Majestic temple build by ISKON on a small hillock called Krishna Hills. It has got a mixture of borth south Indian and North Indian culture.. But You get peace when you enter this temple. At the same time some ISON dvotees are chasing us for donations for their various schemes.,1
One of the most peaceful places I've ever visited.,1
"A well organised entry, car-parking and the queue system. A mind calming walk up the hill with chants of Hare Rama.... The sanctum sanctoriam is an awe- inducing hall of splendor and divinity. The ever patient and calm volunteers add a halo to the experience. A visit worth to make with family and friends. Not the one to pass up if you are in Bangalore.",1

This definitely is a must place to visit in Bangalore especially when you have a nice weather around. The main temple hall is spectacular which gets even better at evening Aarti @1900 IST.

"I think even if not a local , one of the must visit places in Bangalore and have plenty of time since it is a big walk and some quality time with god as well",1
"Very Good Construction, Idol is superb,Only thing is commercialisation is too much. Good Administration,Parking area is Provided",1
"Normally temples in India are overcrowded affair but refreshing not this one. Went early in the morning to be a part of morning aarti and was more than glad to be there. Its build on a huge campus and though we have to tackle just too may stairs to reach main temple, we were charmed by whole religious ambiance. For...",1
A beautiful temple with a very transcendental environment. The Gods will surely bless you with some mouth-watering sweets and prasaadam at the lower floors.,1
"I must start off saying that I am a complete believer in God and am very respectful of all faiths, be it different sections of HInduism or other religions. So if any of my statements offend someone, my most sincere apologise in advance as if at all, it is unintentional. I have had varied experiences over the years. I have visited this temple from the year 1990 during which it has gone through radical transformation. In the 90s, this used to be a calm lovely place (well which place of Bangalore wasn't!!!) and mostly simplistic which had its serenity about it and a sense of spiritual charge. The reconstruction of the grand temple which stands today has chaged the dynamic of the place for me. It stands tall in structure and imposing in presence, but somehow seems more commercial like most temples in India are turning into. I understand the need to generate revenue for the upkeep, but the diversification into associated businesses seems to be dliuting the spiritual feel of this place as many others. Walking through the sales counters at the end of the circuit feels a bit busy and untemple like. more than a few people come there just to snack and hangout, which is all well, but also contributes to the place feeling like a mall with a temple in there. On another visit my wife was pulled outside the line to be told that she should buy a book for her salvation. This could be an isolated incident by an overenthusiastic volunteer, but it was quite forceful and therefore unpleasant. This also probably happened as she is not Indian. She is fully appreciative of India and its vibrance and follows her understanding of the Hindu principles but she felt forcefully targetted. But it is worth a visit and it still has its nice side. My review is more of what doesnt seem right. So go visit and write your positive experiences.",0
"Have visited quite a few Iskcon's but this one is my favorite. Would have visited 9-10 times and I am never bored of this place. Love chanting 'Hare Ram Hare Ram' for 108 times on the steps, love going to the shopping place with books, idols, etc etc and the food joints. The prasad point. Just be aware of the timings. I am not very sure of the morning timings but in the evening it opens only around 4 pm.",1
It's just nice looking good but I expected more then that,1
"The ISKCON temple atop a hillock in Mahalaxmi Layout is a landmark in itself. It is a modern temple built with inspiring architecture with all modern facilities for the pilgrim. The temple complex has a place for tourists to stay, a vegetarian dining hall where Lord Krishna prasadam is served for the devotees, a restaurant called Higher Taste which is a multi cuisine vegetarian restaurant, multimedia rooms etc. The major deities in this temple are Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Krishna Balarama, Nitai Gauranga, Srinivasa Govinda, Prahlada Narasimha. All pujas are performed with great religious fervour and all the Indian festivals are celebrated with great pomp and show. Spiritual Discourses are delivered regularly for the benefit of pilgrims on various topics relating to Indian culture.",1
Awesome temple &amazing,1
Amazing ambience.. Lukin forward to visit again :),1
Good place,1
Plese plese save water,1
Amazing Experience,1
Nice temple with nice view.near to railway station and metro. Peaceful place to relax for mind and body.,1
"Loved the khichdi, bakery items, snacks. Yes, I just got a bit overboard with food, its really sattvik and damn tasty.! Atmosphere is very peaceful despite huge rush on weekends, the decor of the temple is also great. Krishna looks lovely as always, rather mesmerising! and the prasad - Please go eat yourself, you MUST try!",1
Pretty crowded all the time but a good place to get a glimpse of the ISKON movement. The place is quite commercial,0
One of the largest iskcon temple. You will get utmost peace.,1
This is the institution where we come to know ourselves that how lowly we are and it really reminds me in every moment that one should strictly and sincere follow the instructions of Srila Prabhupad and his devotees to reach to the platform where one can understand the real meaning of virtues..,1
One of the best mall I have ever seen in my life. Temple converted very wisely as a mall . Better than orion mall . Lol.,1
Very peaceful with a divine experience.,1
"The Iskcon Temple is one such site that people coming to Bangalore wish to visit. The temple is very organised and constructed to manage a huge crowd. The decoration, grandeur and stories related to the temple add to its qualities. The Aarti is the most awaited and popular activity that needs to be witnessed. The prasadam is very delicious and you cannot stop yourself from trying some awesome delicacies in the canteen. I would suggest people to not miss the Plum Cake. Its the best one in bangalore that i have noticed.",1
Nice place...please visit with the family in the evening hours...it gives immense pleasure....definitely do chant...hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare.....hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna krishna hare hare for 108 times...stay blessed!!!,1
"It's a place one must visit! You can feel the purity in air and the divine air around. Spacious, well maintained, peaceful!!",1
Beautiful temple in the heart of the city. Located near orion mall. You will find lot of shops to buy religious things within the temple premises. Worth a visit.,1
Clean Temple with Good Architecture with a Beautiful View of Bangalore A must visit place when in Bangalore Has a very good Restaurant,1
Beautiful temple complex and very nice to visit.,1
"One of the best places in Bangalore. The temple's located far away from the city, but you can always take the metro from Mantri Square from downtown to reach there. Elaborately and exquisitely designed indoors is a treat for the eyes and the heart. Don't forget to sample the praasadms on offer.",1
Beautiful temple Incredible ambiance.. Spirituality at its best.. One of the best iskcon temples I have ever seen..,1
"The temple is really good to see with beautiful architecture and deities. Sadly they seem to be really money orientated,as around every corner they are trying to sell you something.The cherry on top was that you even had to exit through the gift shop.Not quite in the spirit of Regular ISKCON Temples.",0
"Its a long flight of steps after you enter the gates of the temple till you can get ""Darshan"" but it is so worth it! The premises and the main temple area - all of it is spotlessly clean and managed to perfection. The feeling/experience is indeed deeply spiritual and touches the soul. As you are listening to the kirtan, you wonder what could be more to life than the blessings of the Almighty...",1
I went for a visit on Janmashtami day with my Mom. Got scared seeing the huge crowd and decided to turn back. Will definitely visit again during non-peak timings,0

"A group of vaishnava's have started a trust called hare Rama hare Krishna which has established ISKCON in various places in India. The temple is an finest example of art and delegance, but the trust is what makes it from calling it divine to somewhat an tourist spot. The only good factor is that people are allowed to have dharshan first and then they are made to go on an shopping spree. They are made to go through the shopping spot and are not allowed to break the line to exit. The worst thing is they sell everything like an bazaar and even for eatables u will get everything ranging from samosa's to puffs and even north indian. Annadanam is available for free at selected time intervals. There is also an hotel which is available during the temple hours. The temple closes at 1PM and reopens at 4 PM and is available till 9 PM. Do visit the place atleast once.",1
Iskcon temple is superb temple in Bangalore . they are developing another temple at kanakapura road .,1
wonder full place,1
Awesome place.,1
A small hill lock which was abondoned due to rocks earlier was converted to temple with modern architecture. Once you enter at different levels you find small temples and finally the place of Krishna idol. Overall the inner feeling of visiting temple is missing and feels artificial.,0
"I always hail ISCON for their wonderful temples & Service to society A small complaint : My Royal Enfield Bullet motorbike was officially parked inside the prescribed parking place in Iscon Gokulam Apartment, off Kanakpura Road, Bengaluru. The Motorbike horns have been stolen. This has happened few days ago. How can I park the vehicle anymore ? Vehicle No. KA 05, JQ 6301",1
"As I was walking through this temple premises, I was amazed and overawed at the amount of investment, hard work and dedication by some people, resulting in this great Krishna Temple. Every thing about this temple is nice which is a must visit place for any one who visits bangalore. The maintenance and upkeep is immaculate. Well trained organised devotees are there everywhere to guide us. The main deity Krishna with Radha is a delight to dharshan or see. Unlike the TRADITIONAL TEMPLES IN INDIA, MAINLY SOUTH INDIA , there are not many restrictions except that you should not enter with foot wear and Photography not allowed in the main sanctum. But to be very honest, I did not get the same vibrations here as I normally get in the traditional temples of South India. may be, I am wrong, I don't know. Or may be I looked at it as a tourist. There are so many counters inside selling many items connected with the temples, such as books, photos, dolls, sculptures, sweets, snacks and many more decorative items for house.",1
"Its a huge temple. You need to be prepared to leave your shoes on the entrance and share the same floor with thousands. I suggest to pay the fee and go for the VIP path, is too cloud the other way. Taste some food on the end, enjoy the free sweet and get the soup to go put.",1
"Temple is in yeshwantpur ! Good place for calm , peace, relax tension free etc. visit one times . Good luck !",1
"Perhaps this place is worth a visit, but less from a cultural than a social-political viewpoint. Marriage of religion with commercialism - Hindu variant. Very busy place. If you need to choose for a visit, pick the quieter solemn ancient temples.",0
"Nicely maintained ,clean. Many stalls inside selling religious merchandise. Better avoid visiting on festival days Visited November 2013",1
Very large and beautiful temple,1
"It is a good a place.to visit with whatever spiritual faith you have .you will enjoy the whole atmosphere more than spirituality it's festivity, is it not the a bis festival !one lives only once , enjoy it fullest.",1
For many years Bangalore Iskcon has been a wonderful example of what I believe the founder wanted. Despite the very divisive politics both in India and internationally this place retains it's ambience and qualities. Of course this temple is renowned for it's food program to supply the hungry poor with a hot nutritious meal offered to the deity beforehand and using it's solar kitchen. Another great example of sustainable technology in the energy used and the food supplied. Of course the place remains a great attraction and a place of interest for Bangaloreans and visitors alike.,1
High end engineering... Place for peace..,1
"very peaceful place to visit, it is very near to yeswantpur railway station. easily availability of auto and cab.",1
"A friend from Bangalore brought us to the Temple. This was an experience I will never forget, the whole visit is great and the inside is so peaceful and beautiful. Go there is visiting Bangaluru",1
Banglore Iscon temple is very nice place to visit . its good both in spiritually and entertainment.. people can enjoy a lot with the view.,1
"The moment you enter the temple premises and hear hare krishna chants, it fills your heart with loads of peacefulness. :) I would recommend to go via 108 steps to get the complete experience of visiting the Isckon temple. Nicely maintained premises.",1
"Grand commercial temple. Wont get that ""temple"" feeling. Food is tasty.",0
Excellent place. Although I suggest there should be some arrangement for the aged or physically challenged people. Because it is too difficult for them to walk up such a distance and long queues. God should be accessible to everyone.,1
"The temple is clean and well maintained, especially by Bangalore City standards. Photography is prohibited but you can quickly sneak a shot or two with your mobile, just for memories not for espionage...hah hah. I found the temple to be too commercialized but i assume that it for the purpose of upkeep. I recommend this as a must see site for the tourist, but don't expect anything as extravagant as the Taj Mahal ;)",0
One of the best place in Bangalore. Good place for elderly peoples. Great place even for children. Also the chat centre situated at the basement is awesome. This is something that u shouldn't miss.,1
"Temple's good and one can find peace once you enter into temple but it's so commercialized in Bangalore that ISKCON looks more of a shopping complex rather than a temple. You have to even pay for shoe rent which is totally free in ISKCON, Delhi. Otherwise, everything is good and the products which includes from idol to photo frames, from books to prasad are good. And yes, this Bangalore ISKCON temple also offers few delicious and tempting eatables while exiting from temple.",1
Beautiful sky view. Best to get peace of mind,1
Beautiful Hindu temple. Also try the food available there Watch the movie show at the temple. Try going during Arti time in the evening divine.,1
"Really fascinating visit, although to top off a visit for adults with a cartoon about a blue guy called Krishna was a bit absurd.",1
well maintained with spiritual chants all around. even the pond is clean . the prasaadham is also very tasty.,1
Well organized and beautiful temple in Bangalore. The view over the city in front of the temple just as enjoyable as the stunning carvings and ornaments inside. Must visit when in the city.,1
We visited the temple on a rainy evening. What stands out first is the nearly organised car parking. The entire temple complex is a series of vegetarian food shops on the ground floor...Ranging from over the counter snack shops to exorbitantly priced fine dining. Start climbing the stairs and you will be impressed with the semi modern architecture. Also the queues are efficiently organised and within 15 minutes you are in the main hall. The main hall is grand. A huge capola with frescos from the life of Krishna will keep you mesmerised till you reach the main shrine. For Rs. 150 per family you can break off from the regular line and get a family Darshan right in front of the deity. The way back winds through a series of outsourced counters where vendors try and sell you just about anything with branding of Krishna on the goods. That kills the euphoria and spirituality you felt a few moments back. TIP : The samosas stall on the way out has a good fare.,1
"lord Krishna temple is really good, surrounding clean is ok ok, but inside temple you feel really very good, lunch (prasad) is good (rice samber), must visit , visit again and again, and you get lot of paid snacks, books , etc after darshana, HARE KRISHNA, HARE KRISHNA, KRISHNA, KRISHNA, HARE HARE, HARE RAMA, HARE RAMA, RAMA, RAMA, HARE HARE,",1
"It is a two-in-one destination, in the sense that you get to visit a temple to satiate your spiritual (or religious,whatever the case may be ) cravings and can get wonderful stuff to eat as a bonus! The temple has an atmosphere full of energy with lots of singing (and dancing) at a fixed time. It is very clean and well managed (unlike many Hindu shrines) and the food there is awesome! A must visit in Bengaluru.",1
Hare Krishna hare rama_/\_,1
"One of the best temple I have ever visited. Though I am a life member of ISKCON, It was my first chance to visit this temple. I have been visiting Bangalore since last 4 years regularly due to my business trips, but could never get time. On 26th March Lord Krishna blessed me to find out some time in the evening to get his glimpse in this temple. I am really grateful. This is one of the most neat and clean temples I have visited so far. The premises it self is very huge. the Q management system is perfect. Besides the book stall, the restaurant, the mandapam all are excellent. I will visit again and try to visit each time in all my future trips to Bangalore.",1
You must visit this temple once in your lifetime. Amazing most beautiful temple in the world. Go and visit this temple and enjoy.,1
One of the most visited place in Bangalore. Best time to visit the place would be early morning when there is less traffic and has a peaceful surrounding.,1
One of the best world class temples of ISKCON community. Try to avoid to come here on holiday otherwise you will find...,1
Must go place in Bangalore. Temple located on hill . Great peace. And beautiful view of city in night. Evening aarti is a pleasure and peaceful to watch.,1
the Atmosphere of the place is quite nice...neatness at its level best....worth visiting once...!!!!,0
"I have been to this place even during my college days. This time I went along my in laws. No doubt you will find crowd here almost any time during the week. The campus is clean and well maintained. You have allowed place for keeping your Footwear so that is something, you are not gonna lose on return. The temple is huge specially the Krishna Radha temple. Once you will enter the temple, your thoughts can dive in the divine surrounding or can go rational. I am a devotee but here I feel another aspect of devotion. With all due respect, I prefer this place as a visit spot and not very much as temple. You have shopping area, food Court inside the premises. You will also meet temple priest who will teach you the way to please God. Well everyone has their own definition of God and devotion and so have mine. A good place to be with family without any concern. But you go there.. Do not miss the morning Aarti and the Prasadam they give to all the devotees. Prefer that preparation rather than buying sweets on the name of Prasadam just to avoid queue and crowd. Always remember God never charge you for his blessings but human does for their service.",1
"Its a good temple with plenty of activities. First you can have the darshan and do plenty of shopping. The shopping ranges from religious books, fancy items. food items, organic products, paintings and many more. There are three options to eat, one is the prasadam counter where one can have the traditional puliogare, chitranna, rosogulla, curd vada, and many more sweets and bakery products. There is an mid range restaurant which serves good south indian food and one premium restaurant called Higher taste. Overall a good place for an evening outing.",0
The perfect place for perfect Spiritual knowledge..Must visitable place however Very crowded on weekends and holidays.,1
"You are herded in cattle fashion in rows into the temple complex, where at every possible turn there is a guard saying jalthi karo or something like that.this is only for the places of worship, which is supposedly where you need to pray. then after carefully guiding you through the main temple you are allowed ample time to do shopping of various artifacts and prasadams. ppl seem to be spending more time shopping than praying. a beautiful place turned to business. the place is well maintained and clean in spite of the huge crowds. we did not get to see the full temple from the outside as it was in one way and out the other",0
"We loved this place located close to Yesvantpur railway station. Amazing temple, greatly maintained and with thousand of pilgrimage everyday.sandhyarati is recomended",1
Best temple for prayer but they are doing business by opening so many shops at high rates,0
"Love to visit always.... Devotees are very good, they have right philosophy of God and they are very easy to understand to apply in our day to day life. Which made me to be Happy.",1
"Iskon provides a beautiful spiritual ambience in heart of bangalore city. I went with my parents and wife , both loved the place. Also sm nice fine dining option is available inside the temple premises.",1
The view from the temple is very good. Almost the Bangalore city one can see from the top of the temple. Nearby Metro station is Mahalakshmi.,1
This place is a must go place when in Bangalore. A place with utmost cleanliness and serenity. even though its in the city once you are in the premises it takes you to a different zone for experiencing the aura.,1
"The ISKCON temple is an imposing structure. The darshan process is well organized - darshan should take upto 1.5 hours depending on the crowd. Beautiful decorative lights and songs are played on festival days like Janmashtami. There will also be a lot of people on these days so keep extra time for darshan. The lawns around the temple structure are well lit, they make for a pleasant walk after darshan. Try the vegetarian food at the fine dining restaurant in the same complex, and sample the yunny eggless cakes at the bakery to polish off your visit.",1
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna.... Krishna Krishna Hare Hare .... Hare Rama Hare Rama ... Rama Rama Hare Hare..,1
"Very nice and beautiful place to visit in fact a must visit for everyone, Evening aratis are a special treat",1
Very peaceful & disciplined.,1
"One should not miss visiting ISKCON and taking blessing of God Bhagavan Sree Krishna when someone goes to Bangalore. It?s a totally new architecture composing of south Indian and modern sculpture. The paintings, Golden Deity Idols, Deity decorations catch the eyes of ones. Though it looks bit more commercialized but one should not forget even any big temple surrounding will have small vendors selling food, articles, pooja items, accessories, since there is no private small vendors and space outside the road, the ISKCON itself offers all those things though their shops. Moreover their main aim is to spread the divine message of Bhagavan Sree Krishna, thus their attempt looks like commercialized. I was mesmerized when a Brazilian (Met in USA) knew Bhavan Sree Krishna?s thoughts and teachings just by himself through and it only shows All are equal and eligible to learn any good things and teachings of any religion.",1
A nice and peaceful place in Bangalore. Awesome architecture. Came here with family and we felt good. One suggestion: don't miss this place if you visit Bangalore.,1
Amazing Krishna temple Bhagavatgita and many other books related to spirituality is available...in many languages ha...,1
It is good and serenity visit place is very nice the feeling is divine the crowd is decent when you enter in you feel not to come out,1
"Idols look awesomeFull peaceDarshan at night will be more good to look earlier it was excellant, now a days it has become more commercial.",0
Jay Srila Prabhupada!!! Hari bol!!! <3,1
"A word to describe this temple is ""mesmerizing"". The rich golden figurine & its structure is simply amazing to see in the main temple. There is a long way to reach by climbing many steps - if you like walking. Climbing & walking through the 3 temples converts you to a solemn person.",1
"The Temple is quite nice and very relaxing, It just gives you a good feeling and the architecture is really good.",1
Mind relief place and best atmosphere.,1
Divine!,1
"Sit relax pray even the view from the temple is awesome,you will book fare inside where you can avail different kind of religious book,live counters.",1
Parking:- Car and Bike parking is available Temple : Inside - view of god is amazing with gold every where : Outside - its a very big temple and u will find positive vibes commercial shops :- once u wanted to come out of temple u fell that the way you have to follow is a way to all commercial shops which if u want to avoid cannot and this it doesn't give me a felling of visiting temple its like a mall else if u like to shop and eat food u will enjoy. with such a huge temple there will not be a space to sit and meditate you just have to follow the queue and walk....,1
iskcon temple was one of the famous lord krishna temple in bangalore.i have gone to the iskcon temple and the temple was very nice .,1
I found this place full of energy and interest. There were many people there going thru the temple. I was very happy to have a hotel guide who knew the route. We got the most expensive ticket and were able to go thru special lines to get to the top temple where we were able to sit on the floor and be blessed. The sights and sounds were comforting and interesting. (very different than temples in Japan).,1
Nice place in Bangalore,1
"ISKCON temple of Bangalore has deities of Radha and Krishna located at Rajajinagar, Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world. The temple is a huge cultural complex. The project was conceived and executed by Madhu Pandit Dasa following the wishes of HDG A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of ISKCON to promote Vedic culture and spiritual learning. Features of the temple: There is a gold-plated dhwaja-stambha (flag post) 17 m (56 ft) high and a gold plated kalash shikara 8.5 m (28 ft) high. There is free distribution of Sri Krishna prasadam to all visitors during the darshana hours. ISKCON Bangalore has six shrines: Main shrine is of Radha-Krishna.Krishna Balrama.Nitai Gauranga (Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda).Srinivasa Govinda ( also known as Venkateswara ).Prahlada Narasimha.Srila Prabhupada. The temple is open from 4:15 am to 5:00 am. The day begins with a Grand arati ceremony called mangala-arati followed by worship of Tulasi Devi, Sri Narasimha Arati and Suprabhata Seva for Sri Srinivasa Govinda. The temple again opens at 7:15 am for Shringara Darshana Arati. 5:15 am to 7:15 am: Japa Meditation session. The temple remains open till 1:00 pm. In the evening the temple is open from 4:15 pm to 8:15 pm. During weekends and public holidays Temple timings are 4:15 am to 5:00 am and 7:00 am to 8:30 pm without any break in the afternoon. The evening arati starts at 7:00 pm where devotees sing kirtan. In the main temple the arati is performed by three priests. This arati is followed again by kirtan where devotees can be seen dancing to the rhythm of ""Hare Krishna Hare Rama"".",1
It's a temple - so no thing specific to expect other than being a place where you go to get inner peace. It's well maintained and has specific visiting hours. Only thing which can become little challenging is you have to complete the whole circle round if you want to go inside. Get the laddoo prasad - it's good.,1
Must visit when ever you come to Bangalore. Very clean and well maintained. Don't rush spend some time there.,1
"When you want peace for ur soul, go there. Feel like direct meeting with radhe Krishna",1
All the Paintings inside the temple represents a historical things. A very calm place to spend time with family & friends.,1
"One of the best places to visit in Bangalore. You will love this temple and the god's statue. and best place to do a meditation in front of lord Krishna.. By seeing Krishna you will get mesmerized with him.. It's just an amazing feeling. one should not miss this place, if you are visiting to bangalore.. Peace, breeze and pleasant atmosphere. It stands on Hare Krishna Hill in Mahalakshmi layout Bangalore. The members/devotees of the temple have well behavior and so kind to response.",1
Beautiful Temple. You will get all kinds of snacks and stationary items as well,1
Wow it's was wonderful darshan and enjoy full mahaprasadam.,1
Nice place including water and food services,1
"Nice temple to have mental piece, and great view of city. Once you come out of the temple, you feel that entered into shopping zone, not in the temple. But to spend the time with family is perfect place.",1
Jai nitayi,1
"The premier temple for Krishna worshippers, this is the cleanest and one of the biggest temples you will find in Karnataka. The organisation also caters free food for school children, and you can enjoy a nice vegan lunch in the premises as well for a small price. Plan in advance and take a look at the calendar to ensure there aren't any festivals on the day you're visiting.",1
Peaceful,1
Iskcon Bangalore is far behind as compared to Vrindavan Iskcon. Bangalore Isckon is good to see but the feel in Iskcon is just not same as for other Iskcon. The temple is always full of rush and shops. I don't find such peace in Iskcon Bangalore as was in Vrindavan Iskcon http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r269916283-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#,0
Prefer going on weekdays as weekends temple is crowded with visitors and you wont be able to enjoy the feeling. The temple is located at some good height which provide good views around.,1
"One of the biggest ISKCON temples. Systems for darshan queue are very good and hassle free. They do not allow shorts for men but dhotis are available at luggage counter. Food mall after darshan exit is huge. Has very tasty and hygienic food options. Best time to visit would be after sunset, as climate and views become very good.",1
"Awesome aura around this temple, we visited this place on January 1, 2016 and what a start to the year felt really great.",1
morning aarti of iskon temple made our day very with holy sprite and full of positivity. . prasad they served is very good,1
"This is a large and beautiful temple. Unlike many temples we have visited in India, it is not ancient. It was completed, I believe, in the 1990s. It is very beautiful and quite large. It is the largest eat ISKCON temple in India and one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world. The views of the city from the climb to the temple were very nice. The visit is a self-guided tour with signs explaining various areas, beliefs, rituals, etc. of the Krishna belief. We went in a Sunday night. I think I remember it is open until 8:30pm on Sun. This was a good time to go, as there were not many locals there and basically no tourists. Also, it is cooler at night than during the day. The views of the city at night were also nice. Although entry is free, if one is a foreigner, they try to get you to pay (around $12US) for the ""short-cut"" line. This might be worth it when there are lots of people there, but I have been told even it can be very crowded. Once in either the long or short line, one must remove and leave their shoes in a bag for pick up afterward. This cost a few rupees. There are also other points along the way requiring, or urging additional fees. All told, including if one pays for the short-cut, maybe $25-$30US). On the way out, there are lots of little booths selling all manner of items. All in all, I'd say it's a definite ""should see"" if one is in Bangalore.",0
"Although the surrounding area is very posh and busy being close to the World Trade Center and Orion Mall, one starts getting peace of mind right from the moment he gets in the ISKCON premises. Parking space and management is too good for a temple and cleanliness, guiding the devotee queue, the atmosphere inside the main hall are above par. In addition you can find a huge lot of religious stuff to buy and delicious snacks to eat inside the temple.",1
"I would have rated this temple higher, but once you are done with seeing the (Beautiful) idol of Lord Krishna, you have to go through retail stalls where they force you to buy books and other accessories.. Sometimes they literally don't leave you unless you buy.. That was the most disgusting part of it. And the food stall are all for profit. Not cheaper. Its like a Mall...",0
"One of the beautifully built temple in Bangalore. Sculptures & drawing on the wall are excellent here. when you entre the main dome, the drawings made on the inner wall of dome are awsome. Best time to visit this place is Krishna Janmashtamai when the whole temple is decorated with flowers & lamps. An awsome experience to sooth your eyes. otherwise on normal days, try to avoid weekends as on weekends rush is always expected.",1
I have seen less temple complexes which are clean and organized and this is one of them. You can get blessed by Krishna and also feel the vibes all over with lovely chants .I also had some short eats in there food court which were also excellent.,1
"ISKON temple in Bangalore is one of the best temples in the city . Very good location and with nice , clean and peaceful environment. Architecture and looks of temple are very good and also you can enjoy good views of surroundings from top There increased commercial activity inside temple now like food court and market bu hat is acceptable.",1
Very beautiful temple among all ISKCON temples.,1
"From the rash and rale of society outside the gate to a world of calm inside... A peaceful environs once you enter. Also note that the temple has been well organized. You can also meet other devotees and the priests, who have Das suffixed to their name, because they submit to the deity. A good collection of trinkets and merchandise too for those who would be interested to buy books and collectibles.",1
ISKCON is one of the best place to start your day trip in Bangalore. Very good ambiance and bliss. Good administration and neat & clean. Good restaurants and good facilities. Dont forget to enjoy the Sweet Boli made here. You can have a bot of shopping as well. Laddu prasadam is also a must.,1
I visited the temple on 30th sept in the evening.it is really worth be here.kirtan in the hall was mind soothing & freshening. Educative literature was also on display.. Eating shops were nicely managed .one likes to eat.rates r slso very reasonable. Book store is also worth for buying the holy books .concluding .one must visit this temple.,1
Temple of modern spirituality! The restaurant behind (The Higher Taste) serves great vegetarian food! There's quite a lot of parking but can fill up quickly on auspicious days.,1
As usual beautiful like all other ISKON in the middle of the city. All Krishna lover head to this one.,0
Peaceful place to visit and I like to spend time there. You can enjoy the metro as well nearby. Wonderfull expierience last time,1
"I visited this temple on a Sunday which must be the busiest day for this holy site. But you can avoid queuing up for an hour or more by purchasing a ticket for the fast lane. This takes you to a separate lane past the long line of pilgrims and straight to the main complex. You have to deposit your shoes and your camera before entering the temple where photography is forbidden. (The photos from the inside of the temple on TripAdvisor must have broken this rule). As a fast-track visitor you get right up to the centre altar and receive some petals to give to the monks who say a blessing while spreading them on the altar. You are also given a voucher for a booklet and some foodstuff which I didn't dare eat, so gave it to a local visitor.",0
its really good temple in a huge city like bangalore...good religious place to get peace and must visit,1
Nic to visit iskon.i am going regularly with my all new friend whoever is coming bangalore first time.take caring people.also feeling relax after visiting there.peacefull place.,1
Highly disappointed to see the commercialization of ISKCON. Though the deity remain still the beautiful self but everything around them is so highly commercialized that it has become a mall more than a deity place.. I really like the new ISKCON temple (still upcoming) on Kanakapura Road in Bangalore. Though the whole temple is going to complete by 2016 but the main deity rooms are already in place and without the commercial chasm it really helps the devotees seeking spirituality...,0
One of the modern temple of Lord Krishna in Bangalore city & very posh shopping mall opened just behind the temple Orion Mall. Anyone can reach this place easily by BMTC(Local bus service) as well as NAMMA METRO. Also world trade centre n one more famous Mahalakshmi temple is near to this place.,1
"Sehr eindrucksvoll, modern und professionell gef√ºhrte Anlage mit hoher Kommerzialisierung. √úberall sind zus√§tzliche Spenden-/Kaufm√∂glichkeiten. Der Eintritt ist kostenfrei, f√ºr ""schnelle"" Abfertigung bei Warteschlangen wird eine Geb√ºhr verlangt.",1
This is the right place for the people who would like to spend some time peacefully. Preferred time is in the evening four to eight.,1
Temple has a beautiful architecture and its a place which we should go and explore but the thing which really irritates me is their high commercialized behavior. Entrance gives you a feel of temple but when you exit you will feel like going out from a MALL.,0
"Nice clean temple yourself be guided by the fixed route, join the hare Krishna blessings mantras. They show you the way and just do it, very nice, always people who take you in tow. Surprised because we have a book, a calendar and got goodies with our entrance ticket, a sort of goodies bag;) Bit confusing on TripAdvisor because several ISKCON temples seem to be but there is really only one. Pictures should not, shame because it looks beautiful. Shoes and luggage storage is also very well organized and structured.",1
Super place,1
"A place to visit if you are in Bangalore. Peaceful experience, you get drowned in Hare krishna and Hare Rama call. You should avoid public holiday and Saturdays and Sundays as it is very crowded.",1
"Located at small hill, temple is beautiful and must see in Bangalore for followers of SriKrishna, they do lot of good thing like feeding thousand of children everyday through Akshay Patra. Inside temple, lot of commercial activities being done, like selling of organic food, soveniors, vegeterian cakes and biscuit, two different category restaurants and fast food counters.",1
Place of god,1
Attend the main pooja which happens around 7.30 PM to 8.30 PM which will mesmerize you! Other deity on the way uphill will only reflect the rich heritage of India! The temple is maintained neat and clean.,1
"More of a tourist attraction with plenty of options for eating, but you wont get the feeling of visiting temple since its more of commercial. Its more of tourists attraction rather than a temple",1
Nice,1
i really like iskcon. and in future i want to be a part of iskcon community. i really trust in lord krishna. thank you for a happiness life in the world.,1
It so nice,1
"Peaceful place to visit and have some good time with family, friends, colleagues ets",1
"A very beautiful and well maintained temple. Premises are spotlessly clean, Even on festival days everything is very well organised and darshan is not an ordeal as it is elsewhere. One of the favourite places of worship for many Bangloreans.",1
I liked the environment very much which was very good. Must visit for mental peace.Go and sit at least for an hour.,1
It is the main temple in India in iskcon temples it is located in small hill it is fantastic temple in bangalore,1
"One of the largest Iskcon temples compared to other cities, this place is a unique combination of faith, awesome view, and some good veg food. Especially sunsets, the golden hue of the temple, the lamps, and view of surrounding hills is beautiful. Add to it the evening hymns, and it is truly divine. Also the snack counters are good, have some nice sweets and snacks. Note that when crowded, you are asked to go through the 100 odd steps chanting gods names without directly being allowed to join the line to go in.",1
Spiritual temple at it's best. This place is very very Peaceful and Serene. One can spend entire day at this place for meditation and bhajans,1
Go immerse yourself in Lord Krishna devotion.. Must visit place in bangalore,1
Haray ram Haray krishna krishna krishna haray haray.,1
Peaceful place..,1
ISKCON temples what they're we all know. What's different here. Well it's situated near to Orion Mall and Sheraton hotel. The well organised structure starts right when you enter it. From footwear counter to main temple complex all are well organised. First one gets to entrance with 108 petals where one is required to chant a mantra to reach entrance of temple. Alternate direct route is there from left too. First idol is of Narsingh God. After this is another idol and then you enter the main complex. The paintings on terrace and the chandelier is absolutely beautiful. The main idol of Krishna God is placed here. On exiting you'll be routed through their magazine section. While climbing down is a small tuckshop where one can buy sweets. Below this floor is beautiful carvings for different stages of human. Then again some shops. In next floor again some food stuff and shopping. In next floor again food stuff this time sweets like jalebi too. Then you'll see restaurant. Then there's exit. In all really good temple with lots of food options for visitors.,1
"The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) temple in Bangalore city is huge cultural complex that was inaugurated in 1997. One of the best temple in Bangalore. All modern technologies have been adapted to construct this temple. All arrangements are neat and clean, however one must visit to experience this great temple. This magnificent complex, a blend of tradition and modernity, is a symbol of the dedication and devotion of ISKCON to the cause of bhakti and service. It is an architectural landmark.",1
Nice. Good atmosphere.. very nicely maintained.! Had a great experience on visiting.! :),1
Beautiful place to visit in Bangalore where u can experience a top view of Bangalore above a mountain type temple .,1
This is a lord Krishna and radha temple. It is much crowded by high rise buildings. There are many statues of lord Krishna and goddess radha. In the temple there are many stalls pertaining to God Krishna and goddess radha and also of sweets and snacks. The Prasad offers there was very delicious. It's a must visit place while you are in Bengaluru.,1
Good to visit at evening..,1
Best place for getting relaxed. Very tasty sweets and lunch.,1
"Krishna temples are always nice to visit, but here you get such a great experience by going up the hill, chanting hare krishna in 108 steps, worhiping, lord narasimha, sree venkateshwara swamy..and then sree krishna with balram, radha matha ..its such a great experience going up the hill.. worshiping.. and coming out.. you get such a delicious prasad too every time u visit the temple. ISKON also has restaurant for devotees who come for worship and then relax over weekend and in evenings. All food served are satvik (no garlic and no onion), very nice and delicious food. dont miss that experience too. u get good city view and metro train view too.. from top of the hill .. u wont regret going to this place.. even if u r not a krishna devotee..",1
A nice and attractive architecture of the building. Clean place with full of devotion. Main Hall is really a worth to see. Also well managed shops to buy different articles related to krishna.,1
Spiritual.. Best place for Meditation..,1
"As a new couple, we visited this place and had a very Good Darshan of Lord Sri Venkateswara Swamy, Prahlada Narasimha Swamy, Radha Krishna, Krishan Balram. It was very pleasant and peaceful. Everyone should visit this place at least once they come to Bangalore.",1
Hare Krishna...!,1
Bangalore is fortunate to have Krishna and Iskcon here. A divine retreat for all of us to be connected.. Kudos to Srila Prabhupad..Harekrishna,1
The temple is neat and clean well managed and has a calm ambience unlike from the other temples in India this one has a higher level; of discipline that is followed,1
Hare Rama hare Krishna Krishna Krishna hare hare..,1
"commercialized divinity. You will find food stalls inside the temple ""selling"" almost about anything than serving pra...",1
This is a place where your mind get relaxed and peaceful. The paintings displayed there will speak a lot,1
"We had a one and a half hour visit to the temple. Time was spent on queuing, shopping and (maximum a third of the time) on just ""being there"". We were offered the "" special "" tour, meaning it was not free admittance and that we were going on shopping tour inside the temple. The temple itself is impressive and we spent 15 minutes to just sit down and participate in praying.",0
Calm and Peaceful,1
Superb temple must visit new people . peaceful atmosphere in temple.,1
"Fabulous ISKCON temple in Rajaji Nagar similar to the temples in other major cities such as Mumbai.. However, the size of the premises is huge and you need considerable time for the darshan as well as the various counters selling food items.. very divine atmosphere and one of the must see places in Bangalore, which is included in the city...",1
Amazing place for all those Krishna devotees. For others it might appear as commercial place.,1
"We visited on Radhayatra day, in the evening you feel like it is heaven. We have taken 108 Hare rama steps to go inside, that's an awesome experience. Balaji temple and Main temple Idols are amazing, you will forgot everything when you are inside the. Main Temple. Organizing this are pretty well, i suggest you to visit after 5pm.",1
"I visited this large temple complex devoted to Krishna within the city centre. No cameras are allowed to be used but you can use your mobile to take photos. Footwear must be removed before entering the temple area. There are quite a number of steps to climb before reaching the main worshipping area. The temple is very clean and neat. It appears to be a fairly new temple compared to others I visited and according to my guide, is supported by donations worldwide. I have to say that although it was a large complex I wasn't impressed either by the inside or the out. I was left with the impression that it was more of a business venture rather than a spiritual one; but still worth a visit even just for the photo opportunity.",0
ISKCON Temple Bangalore is sort of an icon in Bangalore. Temple is very beautiful located on a hill but it can get really crowded here.,0
Very clean (which is very rare to find in India) hindu temple. Run like a corporate office. Offers good views. Very organised and one can easily find parking too even though this place is often very crowded. They maintain a strict code of silence in sanctum sanctorum. They have a funny prasadams (holy food offered to God which is subsequently sold to devotees) which are modern sweets and namkheen. Good place to visit when in Bangalore for holiday and sight seeing.,1
Very nice place.All the way you will find mesmerizing architecture & various stages of life of Lord KRISHNA.Very nice & calm place. You will definitely feel relaxed.,1
"ISKCON Sri Radha Krishna temple was inaugurated in the year 1997. It is not just a temple, but a cultural complex housing the temples dedicated to the Deities of Sri Sri Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Sri Krishna Balarama, Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga, Sri Srinivasa Govinda and Sri Prahlada Narasimha. Visited August 2014",1

This is the very good temple to see in mahalakshmi lay out in bangalore . this is the maim attractive place in bangalore . I have visited this place yesterday I usually go to this place often and often .this is the temple of krishna . this temple,1
The Temple sitting atop a hill is a very peaceful and no hasselling with vendors and beggars. The amazing work that ISKON is doing by feeding school children in the biggest and most succesful mid meal programme is conducted at thefoot of this hill. This particular industrialised kitchen feeds 97000 government going school children 6 days a week. This is one of the 2 kitchens in central Bengaluru and employees around 300 people thus not only encouraging parents to send thir kids to get a free meal - through education - but also supports over 1000 people through employment ! The kitchens and schools are dotted in most states in India the whole concept created by Chanchal Pratidasa about 12 years ago today feeds 1.4 million children a day - 6 days a week - on $12.50 a year !!! AMAZING. Ask to visit - they are very well coming.,1
The location is good. Though it is very crowded place the cleanliness is too good. The food quality is good at reasonable price.,1
Sit..relax..chant,1
One of the biggest Iskcon temples in India. It is efficiently managed. Also has lift and wheel chair facility for the senior people.,1
"This is the biggest temple in Bangalore, most famous with the Buddha and Hare Krishna prayers, there are many pray stations and all the people must follow the stations and it's a long time to do all the way. For me it was not so great but it was quite nice... I think that if you not have the time you can skip on that.",1
"Go there in the evenings and there is a step chant thing i.e you proceed to the next step only after you chant 'hare rama.. hare kirshna...'Its clean, organised and has positive vibrations. Sit around for a while after the darshan (prayer)Don't forget to taste the free prasad, once of the tastiest khichdi you can have. The food in general is cheap n tasty there :)`",1
Amazing,1
Iam feeling happy todya is my sri krishna birthday,1
Very well maintained temple. Very calm soothing.,1
I went here with my parents and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. The temple occupies a large area and it is peaceful inside. A must visit if you are in Bangalore!,1
It?s beyond my expectation it?s an amazing family trip for us. Its old and authentic and too mesmerizing experience for us,1
Nice place to visit with friends and family,1
"Visited this beautiful temple located on hill top. Main gods are Lord Krishna & Radha, also Narasimma avathar, Lord Venkateshwara. There is a shoe counter available. Temple is very nicely built, very well maintained. There are prashadams both free and priced, spiritual books for purchase. We sat at the main temple on hill to listening to music in front of beautiful and well decorated deities. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r294851599-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1

Very nice temple. Offers a great variety of prasadam. Just an awesome experience!,1
"Very peaceful I, like very much",1
A very good Temple........:-) must visitable place with family or friends good maintenance is maintained;-),1
Great devotional place,1
"We have been associated with this temple from the foundation stone laying to staphana. We are always keen and eager to go there, including the mangal aarti. We have invited families and friends and they loved it too. An Icon of Bangalore. A must visit if you are in the Garden City",1
This is a must visit in bangalore. Its closed from 1 to 4 pm so plan accordingly. very well managed. shorts are not allowed but they provide you with a mundu. so explore and enjoy,1
"Good temple to visit, thay have all sort of commercial market in the premises, but nobody is forced to buy anything, one can go and sit to have peace of mind.",1
The trip was on 20th Jan 2017. We got only few hours to visit due to change of a train from KSR Bangalore Railway Station. It is around 6 KM from SBC Railway Station Bangalore. It takes around 5 Hours to Visit each and every place of the ISKCON. Really Hats off to ISKCON Bangalore. We have immersed in great Bakthi of Sri Krishna. The Prasadam was awesome taste that was freely distributed by Temple. Many things there to purchase related to Sri Krishna. Awesome Temple and must see narayana temple in Bangalore.,1
We visited ISKCON temple Bangalore and I can say that this is a must visit place in Bangalore. Most of the one day local trip covers ISKCON. The place is so clean and well maintained/organized.,1
Good temple structure. But it might not be worth the 3-4 hours you will spend in driving up to the place and walking up the lines. Moreover you are unlikely to know the darshan timing and even if you know it you can barely manage to plan your time with the unpredicable traffic conditions etc,0
Beautiful temple to visit. The place is quiet and clean.Beware of cheap quality products sold in the temple.,1
Awesome temple,1
"Located on a hill top the architecture is fairly good , but does not invoke any divine feelings though.Many steps to climb up and looks more artificial , organised place ,crowded during week ends .Worth for a single visit.",0
"Compared to the ISKCON in bhubaneswar, its much better, bigger, and has a magnificent architecture. If u want to spent some time with the presence of lord Krishna in its vibe...THEN IT IS THE PERFECT PLACE!!! Just one complaint that the committee people have started a business in the sake of god there as well as in bbsr which is quiet depressing!!!",1
"ISKON is propagating the teachings of Lord Krishna throughout the world ever since it was established by its founder Sri Sri Prabhupada You will find hundreds of beautifully and attractively printed books on Lord Krishna published by ISKON in this centre. The metal images of Lord Krishna and His consort Radhe are the main attraction in the temple While entering you will see the temples of Lord Narasimha and Lord Sri Venkateswara and many other idols of Gods The priests do perform pujas in their own way and style singing the Bhajan jn the fashion know to them Some of its Office bearers had visited my Law chamber for consultation particularly on my books' Law of Clubs in India' and 'Karnataka Revenue survey Manual' I have visited the ISKONS in other important cities like Mumbai, Brindavan etc. I sat on meditation for hours without mindful of time. No one disturbed me. I like that silent atmosphere which is ideal for prayer to please God",1
The main temple is impressive with all golden details but there is too many visitors at ones and the visit feels a bit stressed and you are not allowed to take pictures inside,0
The reverberance and the sanctity of this temple are to be experienced only by your visit. Nothing much can be written for most of the experiences here are so overwhelming. The free Prasad and the restaurant with authentic vegetarian food make the place visitable at any time of the day.,1
"Although I am not the religious type, this is one place in Bangalore I have visited multiple times with my friends or family. Simply because they are very happy visiting this place and I am also not averse to it. Splendid architecture, well organized. Extremely neat and clean. Good options without onion and garlic at great and innovative. Enough parking space. Kids will also enjoy. Only callout is that it is somewhat commercialized, selling a lot of things to devotees.",1
Most amazing place !! Experience peace and divinity here !!,1
Nice place. Calm environment.,1
Every task is made easy here.!!!!!!! I love being here,1
Hare Krishna hare hare,1
"Vibrant, Clean. You can find modern evolving Hindu culture here. It is not typical Hindu temple where Hindu's worship. Good for foreigner to get glimpse of Hindu devotion in modern times.",1
One Of the most Popular temples in Bengaluru city. A must visit for everyone.The view of the city from top of the tem...,1
"You will receive absolute peace of mind when you visit ISKCON Temple with Sri Krishna chantings and devotional slokas. But if you are visiting on festive days, plan early to reach as there is Parking issues.",1
"I absolutely love this place, the vibes the scenes and the devotion and love for Lord Krishna, makes this place my favourite spot in Bangalore.",1
"we had gone to this temple on vikunta ekadashi day,very rush but very professionally handled by Iskon managment.",1
Great place,1
Came in here unintentionally and was pleasantly surprised. The complex is quite huge and very clean and well maintained. It is free to enter and walk around. A popular temple and site of devotion it was stunning and nice to visit especially since it is right in the middle of the bustling city. Overall i really enjoyed the visit and even got into a little discussion with the priest who was trying quite desperately to convince us to buy a book on Krishna but don't let it put you off. At the end of the visit you can indulge in some of the local delicacies.,1
"It is first place to visit in bangalore, though it is temple, the place in the temple makes u really pleasant . From there you could visit Orion mall too.",1
Peaceful place where we can pray and tell pur problems to lord krishna,1
"Its easier to reach the place via metro, the station is less than a kilometer far. The temple is on the top of a hill, the view is good from the metro train than from the temple gate itself. Its a well managed temple which looks more like an urban structure than a traditional temple. You need some amount of patience as quite some time has to be spent in queues. As you climb the steps there are smaller sanctoriums of Narasimha swamy and Balaji. Inside the main hall there are a few altars dedicated to Krishna, Radha and Balaram. You can sit and relax there for some time listening to the Bhajans. There are quite a number of shops selling various stuffs from religious books to eatables which can be considered as prasada and also a super market. It can be considered for a half day outing.",0
Everyday festival in ISKCON Bangalore I love it very much,1
"If you need to learn about India culture, you should find some time to visit Iskcon Temple. It is very interesting to walk through all the routine by take off your shoe, wash your feet, follow the rout which is leaded to the series of gods and to the main temple. In side the main building is very interesting, a monk will perform some ceremony for the prayer and you can sit down and observe the whole time. I love the atmosphere which is very mystical and faithful.",1
Very pleasant and organised crowd management! Darshan also happened pretty smooth..just keep in mind the temple closing time.,1
My trip to the temple was both awe inspiring and spiritually uplifting. The energy is electric and the beauty and architecture inside is so beautiful and the chanting and prayers soulful. The murthis are a work of art and i left feeling spiritually uplifted !,1
Very calm and quiet place. Neatness is maintained everywhere. We liked the atmosphere and system. We all sat inside the temple comfortably for a long time. The volunteers were very cordial and supportive. Visited December 2013,1
Super place to worship who love the Lord Krishna and Radha and i have found one thing it is very interesting in this temple that is life cycle of human birth & death in that death is only for body not for soul. Good example for everyone...,1
Had an opportunity to visit ISKCON Sri Radha Krishna-Chandra temple few weeks back on a Saturday at 5am. We were really enthralled looking at the proceedings of Abhishekham performed for Lord Nrsimha.,1
"It's free to enter, clean & peaceful. Good to spend a few hours to learn about Hindu religion . All u need to do is remove ur shoes & place into a bag . Only hindsight beware of crowd at festivals",1
"I don't like the shopping area being there in the temple.. It make it a market selling, cake , samosa etc",0
A great place to be in Bangalore. Clean and well maintained temple timings of the temple could be looked at,1
Peaceful temple with good environment and the costs are affordable in the temple,1
Anyone visiting bangalore must ensure a visit to this temple. It is so beautiful and serene.The moment you enter the main gate you can feel the presence of the Lord .Beautiful idols of God.,1
Awesom Temple Awesome Prasadam ..Peace is where Find Peace Here,1
"The temple run by Iskon org is situated in Rajaji Nagar. It has the deity of Radha and Krishna and is often called as Sri Radha Krishna Temple. One can truly immerse yourself into the workship of Lord Krishna. Or else the ambience and the surroundings will make yourself immerse in it if you are a true bhakt of Lord krishna. The temple also provides souvenir shops, book stalls and food courts.",1
"Amazing place,you can feel the magnetism when you meditate .",1
when reach this place u feel the peace of lord krishna. i enjoy everything at this place. for peace and ambience is best for this place.,1
one of the most beautifully maintained with excellent ambiance for all lord Krishna devotees. it also has guest house at reasonable cost and lovely food - a low cost restaurant and a mid level cuisine - both are very good.,1
Great place.. it doesn't need star rating.. the name is itself enough,1
This is great spiritual place. LORD OF KRISHNA ETC,1

Unique place where you can find god and a mall having all sorts of articles.,1
The ISKCON temple is the most beautiful temple located on a hill providing a scenic view of the city. Inside the temple it pleasing experience to watch devotees of lord krishna performing pujas and aarti. Its definitely recommended religious place to visit with your family.,1
this is purely a business center nothing divine in this place the food material;s used are very substandard from govt suppikled ration (public distribution system) illegal use Devotees beware,0
Great place to unwind your mind and have a spiritual experience with Lord Krishna here. Feels good to meditate and connect with the spiritual atmosphere here. Food is good plus there are nice things to shop also. Worth the visit.,1
"Very beautiful temple. Sankirtans, bhajans are very pleasant to hear.",1
Everything is commercial there. No feeling of religious place.,0
Very nice place,1
"Its a temple for rich but, not for poor. High cost on products.",0
"The temple is located in Malleswaram. Good connectivity by a cab, Bus and local Autos. Would take you 45 minutes to 1 hour from the city center MG Road or Commercial street. Great temple. The idols of lord krishna, his consort Radha, brother balarama is the main attraction . There is a vishnu temple and Narsimha temple too. Prayers offered are wonderful to witness. The lord and the guru is revered everyday. Hare krishna hare rama. There is a space for books, shopping and food for children. Play areas for one and all.",1
"This place is more of a commercial space. You will less find the temple-temple atmosphere. But good for children - they have a small theatre with 4D movie facility. The temple - Sanctum Sanctorum is very very neatly maintained and you have huge place to sit and do meditation or see the god. There is no time restriction for people who want to sit and feel the place. Once, you are out of the Sanctum-Sanctorum, you can find lots of shops selling fresh foods starting from sweets to samoza. The Aarti in the temple is a bliss to watch with all the lights and the chantings.",1
"Many locals, a little bit of queuing. Buildings are grand, but the lack of fine. After the tour is half the number of commercial shops, including a lot of food, souvenirs and so on. If the time is not particularly restructuring, to see do not see.",1

"Coming to ISKCON is always Divine experience. ISKCON is well connected by Buses, Ola & Uber and autos. It is very different from other ISKCON temples in terms of its structure. ne gets a feeling of visiting ancient time building. There are some wonderful statues in temple hence must visit for people visiting Bangalore. Good time is early morning or after 4 pm as one has to walk up and down on marble floor which get very warm during the day time in summers.",1
Structure is amazing and temple atmosphere is so serene. It is managed very orderly despite the massive crowd. It only took us 15 minutes to get to the main temple.,1
One of the most beautiful ISKCON temples in India. Well maintained and kept offers good food can be easily accessed from any part of the city,1
"This is a place liked by all god fearing people not like me as I like it for its architectural designs and shaved head with a pony tail. Nice place .... not much to say except HARE KISHNA HARE KRISHNA , KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE HARE . HARE RAMA HARE RAMA , RAMA RAMA HARE HARE",1
"Situated atop a hill near Yeshwantpur in Bangalore, the temple is a must for visitor's and locals. Beautifully designed, it is managed nicely and the long queues can be less intimidating than at other places of worship in India. The ""for sale"" counters within the sanctum of the temple do tend to take away from the holy nature of the...",1
"Actually this place is very nice and peaceful to spend some time. They do good pooja., we get nice food to eat also . Nice parking place inside the temple premises People who visit bangalore must visit this place . And people living in bangalore must also visit on weekends.

Yes, its commercialized in some sort, but there are ways to.avoid it. The painted ceiling in the main sanctum are beautiful, very similar to those in Krishna temple at Mathura.",0
"You might enjoy a lot of things here, the architecture, the people, the food etc. Finding spirituality is another task all together. At best, it is a peep into the workings of the isckon community. Interesting but not my cup of tea.",0

Peace full place and actually darsan of krishna God,1
Lovely Lord krishna,1

Great temple with great look Nice place for foodies and travelers They can try many different chats and dishes in reasonable price too There are many materials for shopping too,1
"i had been to Iskcon temple last month along with my family. We had been to temple by evening 6.30. It was a Saturday, so the temple was very crowded. But volunteers manged the crowed very well . The place is very spacious. we need to keep our shoes near to the entrance. The ISKCON has many small temples in it. once you are in front of the main temple, you can see amazing view of Bangalore. I think photography is prohibited in the temple premises. When you enter the bhajan hall, you will get a amazing feel. all will be in prayers. Securities will push you before you pay or see lord Krishna. I could see the people who came in 100 rupees pass, the priests treating then royally, for others securities treated like slaves. The temple has big canteen, they provide 3 time free food. Also they has big bakery inside the temple, so you can buy sweets from there. The best time to visit the temple is morning 5-30 to 7.30",1
Huge temple with amazing atmosphere,1

This is built on a hill in Rajajinagar.I admire the beauty of this temple and the service they provide to the community. ISKCON is providing mid day meal for thousands of children every day. There is also a place wherein you can have organically produced fruits and vegetables. Place is reachable by autos/buses/cabs. The temple is worth a visit.,1
The temple is very easy to visit because of the efficient management of the visitors. Beautiful ambiance in the temple . Good for an outing considering the options in the food stalls.,1
"Good temple, located near metro station, have to walk and climb a lot of stairs to reach the main temple at the top, the whole structure is well organized to avoid stampedes or rush, nice shops inside however quite costly items which can be bought from outside as well at reasonable rates.",1
Simply awesome,1
Spiritual heaven on earth,1
I have never waited so long to see my almighty the temple is well organised but if we wanna make a quick getaway its not possible as you have to walk thru the way mapped by the builders of the temple...the temple is quite big and a must go place but yet wish they had a short cut for those who jst wanted to do darshan and not sight-seeing...,0
Good,1
I love Krishna Krishna is a supreme of God and shree Radharani ji is first devati in Krishna ji,1

"A must when you visit Bangalore.The temple is built on a hill.This connects to the Krishna movement. A visit here would certainly lead you to a journey of to tranquil experience and a sense of mental peace creeps in. You would also be treated to a unique viewing of the Krishna movement with the latest audio video technology.You could treat your elf with sumptuous vegetarian meal of high hygiene standards.Do not miss out on the "" Prasad"" the return offering from the temple. A religious place maintained by professional who are volunteers after shunning of wonderful excellent global and national careers.Their social commitment providing mid day meal for million of school going children is world class.Laudable beyond words.",1
The calming effect that the temple has on you is extra-ordinary. In these stressful times does help to remember God and do some introspection,1
"If you are in for a spiritual trip the ISKCON is a must.India is a place for spirituality.The devotion and commitment with which the temple pujas are performed is something to experience it yourself.The clean environment, and the systematic ques and darshan is something amazing.

"This is the best place to spend the time with family and the best time at shopping place we can buy so many things which we wouldn't get from out site, specially made at ISKON",1
One of the most beautiful temples I have ever seen. more aesthetic than a spiritual experience.,1
This place is too commercialized and it should not be called as a temple . There are people standing everywhere and it looks like that you have to pay for every step you take. So you choose how you want to go to this place,1
Paid a visit during a business trip. If I can give you one tip: you can buy a vip ticket to bypass the lines.,1
It's offers you the peace and quiet you'd want from a temple and it also offers Khichdi as prasadam...very very tasty,1
I liked the systematic way of darshan here.People follow a queue for it.Nice ambience.Entry through Hare Rama Hare Krishna Mantra chanting steps gives you a feel good experience.Nice place to be with your family or friends for a spiritual experience.This temple has good food served in its eateries too.,1
"Definately a must see but no photos allowed so you can't share with friends, but culturally A must. Probably the most spectacular temple in Bangalore if is located in a very built up area close to one of the main shopping districts.",0
"This is indeed a very special place, and it is more inspiring and more spectacular with each visit. I came here in the early days and what has not changes is the cleanliness, the attention to detail and the sheer intensity of prayer and devotion",1
Calm and serene place,1
This is the best krishna temple in Bangalore i have visited. This temple is where I found that the rituals performed here are beautiful and feel to watch the rituals being performed again and again. Please make a visit at least once if coming to Bangalore.,1
"The Iskcon temple is located near to the Yeshwantpur station. It can be reached by any of the public transport local train, metro, bus. The place is very well maintained and clean. The inside ambience is amazing. The main temple is spectacular. Pro TIPs: * Go early in the morning if you want to see the aarti. * Free Khichdi can be taken multiple times. Dont feel shy to ask. They do not say NO :) * Photography inside the main temple is not allowed so do not try to take picture, you may end up getting scolded by the priests who are normally very smiling :)",1
"One of the very best ISKCON temples i have been to. Its huge, beautiful and so serene. Would love to go every day.",1

Visit will not disappoint you of what you have read or heard. One should surely try here although distance may be a cause.,1
Well going to a temple is always good. Iskcon temple is amazing.one can feel the presence of God here. Beautiful temple.,1
"The whole experience of being here is good but the time taken to reach the shrine is thru the selling activity .,the devotion and the regimentation clash here . Once inside the shrine - the very glimpse of deities and the founder are enough to evoke the feelings of joy just bring there .. On The way out is also , thru the commercial,outlets selling food , books , curios and much more . Be careful how much Prasad you want in your hand .i could not eat the most of it.,There are no dust bins in sight . Wish there were less commercial part of it . http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r288446989-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
"The temple is WOW, nice and eye-catching design. . It is spacious and modern. At the end of your visit you realize the efficient management of the temple. Crowd management is good. We went during early morning and late night but even then it was bit crowded. The guest house is better than some hotel. It is very clean. We were bare foot but no feeling of dirt. Floors are shining. Rooms are spacious and meets all requirement of temple visit. All function of room work. The are no dripping faucet or non functional lights. Took meal in the free lunch hall. Clean and non smelly affair. The whole complex shows efficient management. Only on the bhakti it was found to be lacking. Overall nicely executed show but less of a TEMPLE.",1
Good to be in krishna sanidhi,1
"Lovely huge temple complex, pay for parking, pay to enter... Pay more then get to be closer to the altars...( is that fair? )... But I love what they do, love the chanting and the biggest sanctum is glorious . Ceilings painted. Go see !!",1
Its good sheer Krishna temple after that you have to go through retail shop or u can say market to sell their items.,0

Pleasant place to end your week. Devotee of lord Krishna can have his best times at visit ISKCON. Calm place at heart of city.,1
The temple is located on top of a hillock in the city and can be reached by way of transport. A climb and the view of the city is marvellous. The main deity is showing himself in all splendour and you will be moved with emotions standing in front of the deity. The place is well kept by the volunteers to keep the divine atmosphere. There are few restaurant also where you can get the prasadams as well as the typical vegetarian menu.,0

"Gita translation into Malayalam is great. Unbelievable sound effect. Yes, there's no middlemen involved. God Krishna and Arjun. Dear friends, please purchase 1 CD and give to your friends, relatives and students. Let them understand Gita, let them brave hearts.",1
"Visited the ISKCON Temple's restaurant named ""Higher Taste"". It's a delight for vegetarians, the buffet spread is large and bountiful, lot of paneer varieties and unlimited Indian and western styled sweets. And it's all cooked in a pure and spiritual atmosphere with an aim that food is the ""prasadam"" an offering to god. Profit is not the motive, even the food that is left at the end of the day is distributed to charity. And If you are not at all interested in this 'God' n 'Prasadam' stuff, then this will work for U, ""you can have finger licking, awesome vegetarian food which is not too pricey"" Go at once and you will feel the difference.",1
Love it,1
"i had VIP tickets so the queue was not a problem. Peaceful place and nicely built. On rainy days and people with problem climbing stairs, just give a second thought to travel.",1

I have been there many times,1
Beautiful place. Easy flow of queues. Serene and tranquil. A must visit when in Bangalore. The prayer group softly chanted and the public could join in. Amazing paintings on the ceiling of the temple. Devotional literature can be purchased from the prayer goods shop at the temple. No entrance fee,1
"It seems strange but the Temples Indian I've never enough. This and 'one of the most modern centers of the city, but its charm and' still lively in the memories. To try and 'also the self service in the courtyard of course Indian specialties.",1
The temple is really beautiful with gold and marble Idols and decoration around. Simple yet wholesome food is served free for all devotees.,1
It's more kind of mall to purchase spiritual and other items and enjoy veg food and pastries etc. Temple is just part of the show. Should be visited once to have idea of business. Keep at-least INR 50/person ready you will definitely spend.,1
"Nice place to eat out, you've so many options to choose from. The discipline, cleanliness and the ambiance is very well maintained here. Very cleanly atmosphere friendly treatment good food well organised.",1
"Worth every bit, will definitely love the place and atmosphere there. Also they offer variety of food items, very clean and hygienic. Auspicious and extremely beautiful.",1
This temple is located on a small hillock in Rajajinagar in Bangalore. The walk to the temple requires climbing the hillock. The temple has well laid steps. It is very attractive and beautiful to go in the evenings. The artificial fountains and falls created around the temple adds to the attraction. You first come to the Narasimhaswamy Temple and then...,1

Free food or lunch was served from 11.30 2.30 which was very tasty with sweet,sabji samabr and buttermilk.",1
You must visit this place if you are in Bangalore. It is so clean and peaceful. You start with chanting hare krishna hare rama 108 times on flat steps... you then get to see lord narasimha and lord lord govinda. It is a bliss when you enter inside the main temple! It is so beautiful and very peaceful. Most tourists forget to look the ceiling when they sit in the main temple? so make sure to look up and you will find beautiful art of lord krishna... you get to do bit of shopping inside the temple? there is a new Metro nearby that connects to Malleshwaram in Bangalore which is a old and great shopping place in Bangalore? the only thing I hate these days is the rising building around the temple.,1
Beautiful place & can find peace of mind,1
Every thing is good except commercialisation,1
Hare krishna.,1

Nice temple of Sri Krishna by the ISKCON society. Well neat and clean near to Yeshvantpur railway station on top of a small hill. You can go by stair case which is advised by the holy devotees. If not you can opt for a cab also. There is a nominal entry fee. Best time for visit is 6.30 pm you can attend the arati as well.. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r303631487-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#,1
"A very well maintained place. I am not a religious person at all and I went here with my family because I had heard so much about this place and it happened to be close to where we were staying and we had a whole day with nothing else to do and so we decided to give this place a try. And I'm glad that I did. After a few minutes in this place something started bothering me, something that was not quite what you would expect in a temple and I couldn't put my finger on it. And then it hit me! This place is CLEAN! And no SMELL!! No beggars at the entrance!!! The cleanliness is something that you do not associate with temples usually. There, I have said it. Sad, but true. Let us face the truth....temples are not very clean because you usually see rotting fruits, coconuts and flowers being thrown around and temples usually have a peculiar but unique smell (like our railway stations. You can smell a railway station before you reach it). ISKCON is squeaky clean and only has a pleasant smell. That is a big plus in my book. There is a constant, repetitive, droning chant going on over the discreetly placed public address system. You can not escape it. It follows you everywhere like Mary's little lamb. If you like such things, you'll find it quite peaceful and divine. For me it got old in a hurry and started driving me a little crazy after an hour or so. Well, that's just my opinion. You may find the droning voice quite soothing. They have a big area selling some nice posters, statuettes, lovely T shirts and other trinkets. There is a big walk-around restaurant where they sell very good, tasty meal for a very reasonable price. This place was not that clean but I think you should blame it on the people who visit and not the management. Even though there are many dustbins some people were dumping their plates where they stood and not in the bins. But I think we will learn to keep our public places clean very soon. Like in a million years. I mean, what is the big hurry? As you leave, they give you prasadam which is quite tasty. They give it in a disposable cup and again our people just eat and dump those cups all over the place except in the dustbins. Only these two areas are not so clean (even though the employees/volunteers keep picking up the discarded food plates). Give this place a try. You will need at least 2-3 hours inside.",1
"I somehow don't like it, its artificial.",0
good for outing with friends,1
Me and my friends enjoyed a lot in ISKCON temple Its a one of the most biggest temple in Bangalore and you have to visit it,1
"I was not expecting this to be such an interactive and welcoming visit! Be open to the experience and you'll enjoy it. If you're a tourist from outside India, remember to dress appropriately (arms and legs covered-men and women), but they will cover you up for a deposit fee, if you happen to show up unprepared. All temples in Bangalore do not allow shoes inside so be prepared to be barefoot while you're walking around inside.",1
I have been to this temple multiple times with family and you feel happy when you visit with your family. A nice temple built on top of hill.,1
The Krishna idols was the only thing that was good at this place. This place was so much commercial almost everything is sold here. The pathway to the temple and also the way out is dotted with shops selling food and prasadam. The whole idea of spiritual walk went for a toss.,0
"Temple has got very disciplined qued system of Darshan with Ram ram hare hare..... wich give very concentrated move to God temple with unique experience. Prasadam is available in the temple. There are several shop, visitor can shop anything for memories of this temple. Parking facility is available. It is connected from main road. Public transport is also available to go to this temple from bengaluru bus stop or railway stations.",1
Nice place to get darshan of Lord krishna,1
Divine place.One of the best ISKCON Temple I ever visited. You can find variety of food options and stationery in name of the Lord. Easily Accessible transport. Metro is better way to reach out.,1
A must watch,1
beautiful place to visit. beautifully maintained and managed. food is okay. all the services provided by the authority is good and with the number of people visiting is acceptable. little of showbiz.,0
Lord Srinivasa Govinda in a special alankara A regular feature during the Vaikuntha Ekadashi celebrations at ISKCON Bangalore for the last three years has been the free online archana seva. It is,1
"There is not much to dislike, other than trying to get in. If you end up on the wrong day (maybe right if you are a Krishna devotee) and long queues, you may find it frustrating and challenging to be in the line, however, if it isnt a special day or festival day and you easily get in, you will marvel what you see.",1
"good secinic view from ISKON bangeluru,well maintained & neat place,especially go in evening for beautiful view",1
Several options of deserts. Good place for a weekend outing.,1
Very biggest Krishna mandir in karnataka,1
"Great temple for worships. Nice temple,all around beautiful atmosphere Bangalore identification place.",1
People who are new to Bangalore or on a visit should include this location as part of their city tour. Worth it!,1
"Basically a big money-making enterprise dressed up as a spiritual experience. Very popular with the locals, though.",0
"ISKCON Temple Bangalore, a beautiful and nice place to worship, huge Radhe Krishna temple with great infra, but you will be forced to pay money at entrance by some pandit ji. The temple is great, huge, clean give beautiful darshan of Radhe Krishna, and you will find peace, music and nice songs of bhakti is good. There is a huge market place below mandir complex managed by ISKCON Temple. Overall it nice to visit but I dont like the attitude of pandit ji of asking money for darshan.",1
"Must visit place in Bangalore. You can spend at least 3 hours here. Has a very warm feel. If interested, you could buy some devotional books here as well",1
"If anyone asks me what would i suggest a traveler to visit in Bangalore first, I would say the Iskcon Temple. This place is so well maintained & systematic, that one will get such a good feeling. Every religious place should follow this. The devotion would come automatically once you reach the main temple place inside the huge complex. There is separate line for physically able persons. There is also separate shopping area & food court.",1
"Temple built on a hill with beautiful interiors and great views near Chord road, the evening Puja is a spectacle,",1
Eyes just can't believe the sight of the temple. Especially the main BHAWAN. All gold and KRISHNA RADHA are always there. Exceptional paintings on roof. Beautiful architecture. Only downpoint is the shopping mall created on the way to exit. They try to sell everything and anything in the name of GOD which felt like a WRONG NUMBER. We were not allowed to the FRONT of the idols as we were not MEMBERS OF ISKCON and neither had we bought the SPECIAL POOJA THAALI for 350/600/1100 etc etc. So much in the name of god. He is Krishna. He gives you all. You CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT give him anything. Will visit the temple again.HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE. HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE.,1
Visit temple guest,1
Loved the place .,1
A remarkable place. The splendor & quiet of the main sanctum erases all the discomfort of reaching there.,1
"Iskcon temples are one of the best, beautiful clean temples in india. People chanting hare krishna hare rama, really makes you feel that you are sitting some where out of the world.

great place,1
Excellent architecture. Holy place.,1
"I visited this place many a times and it became one of our must visit place whenever a relative comes to my home. I did my master from IISc which is in Yeswantapur and ISCKON is very close. This place very nice, calm and peaceful. One can sit and relax for a while and enjoy the breeze. The Lord krishna Idol is super and one cannot turn his eyes. It is really nice to go in the evening. If you are visiting, please try to inquire the timings and visit as they close the darshan for sometime in the afternoon.",1
It's always wonderful place to visit in physical presence of Lord Krishna. I really love this place in Bangalore,1

"Hare Rama, Hare Krishna....chanting n climbing up the stairs leads you to the shrine. On the natural rock the temple is well maintained walk on the bare foot is never felt dirty. Its a huge place. Loads of collection of books and also amphitheatre...animation movies of lord krishna is played some time. Food stalls r organised on festival days. Overall memorable place to visit.",1
It is near Rajajinagar I have visited many times We will get blessing of God little Krishna Its nice place to visit who came to see Bangalore,1
One of the marble temples which is well maintained. Don;t go in shorts or sleeveless you will not be allowed inside. Its located on a hill which is a highlight. Either you visit for worship or to have a look at the engineering. Its good.,0
"""Management system is nice.., each time we visit our temple .,We enjoy bhajans and kirtans very much........ Lord's and radharani's idols, ornaments and decoration are very much attractive and beautiful....But Luxury things and materials are costly and less attractive... ... what we expect from you is .,keep up the same spirit for few more decades and so on........",1
"very calm n cool place, nice prasad and very high quality food available but now it has becomes full professional as you have to go thru those narrow lanes and forcefully have to go to all places on the route to main deity....if you are in hurry and only want to go to main deity you cannot.....",0
We were here for a Deepotsava celebration and the atmosphere was exhilarating. There are places to have a meal on site as well and a shop for devotional material.,1
"A very interesting Hare Krsna temple in the heart of Bangalore. Definitely worth a visit if you're already in the city. Ticket prices are low by European scale. You should also pay the extra for the Fast Lane, this is worthwhile when many visitors want in the temple.",1
Jai Shri Krishna. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna.... Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama.... Rama Ram Hare Hare,1
"A definite place to visit, i usually like to go with my friends, The arrangements at the place are really very good.",1
"ISCKON Bangalore is a really well architected piece of wonder. The greenery around the temple is commendable and the campus sprawls over a vast area. Inside, the carvings look really good and take you to a different world. The only con to this visit was the over-commercialisation of the entire exit passageway. It is really a spiritual mall selling books, audio-cds, ornaments, clothes, food etc.",1
The glorious temple of sri Krishna Chandra,1
Verry -2 good temple I like it and I want to see this temple.,1
"The Process for Carrying out Srila Prabhupada?s desires for Future Initiations? ?a paper compiled by the GBC in consultation with higher authorities. This paper has a few references to sastra, and gives a general outline of the way in which the process of initiation would go on in ISKCON. It is more a summary of GBC policies than it is a scholarly paper. Some aspects of it?such as saying that disciples have a choice as to whom they take as guru?were not instituted. It explains that new gurus will be chosen by the group of existing gurus, in order for the process to have ?spiritual characteristic",1
ISKCON TEMPLE worth appreciating and experiencing monumental piece of art and sculpture.Environment of temple is peaceful.However certain sectors are more commercial oriented.visit is not recommended for senior citizens above 65 and people with weak heart due to steep stairs,1
One of the must visit places in Bangalore. Very quiet and peaceful place. Also great for a quick bite!! I visited a couple of times just for the samosas and chats available there. :),1
Devotional place ..spacious .nice view from temple top of the city. Lots of foods to eat inside temple . Well maintained-neat and clean,0
Good temple to visit in Bangalore,1
"Beautifully built temple, well organised but it's totally into making revenue. Every thing is on sale and it feels more like a mall of worship. Pooja s are really expensive and there is special preference for people who pay more",1
A best peaceful place with great infrastructure.. I love to visit Iskcon temple again and again,1
"Beautiful Temple organized over three levels. When I went there were prayers and chants going on continuously. It is worth to pay 300 rupies to get the full temple tour and front walk. IT makes the experience much more enjoyable rather than being crammed with a bunch of people. Make sure you sit at the top level and meditate over the cycle of life. You never know, you may enlighten :)",1
Have 2 improve,0
"in this busy town of Bengaluru, this beautiful temple is an abode of peace. Amazing marble work and environment",1
Nice holy place.very peaceful.The all doing their duties very well.well behaved.nice experience.,0
Om shanti!! Amazing place for spiritual unwinding. Take a drop taxi and not full day one.... There is magical power in the place that will ensure you do not go further but will be mesmerized to stay.,1
Best temple to visit,1
"It has many temples inside, main one is Krishna temple.. But the environment does not feel like other regular temple, DO NOT expect feeling of sacred place,(Bhakti).",0
Temple part is amazing. The other half of the building is more of a shopping complex.,0
"ISKCON temple is a place worth visiting. The temple is built on a small hill and the view from the top is awesome. The temple structure is huge and very beautiful. There are lots of beautiful paintings on the ceiling, inside the main temple. The place is an excellent example of South Indian art and architecture. Well maintained premises. There are shops inside the temple, selling beautiful idols, incense sticks, clothes, tasty vegetarian snacks, fruit juice etc. There is one canteen in the premises which serves pure vegetarian food. I enjoyed my visit to the ISKCON temple.",1
Its a beautiful temple and would love to visit again . Only problem for old or people with medical problems is that they have to walk a bit more. Reaching by public conveyance is a bit difficult. Overall a place worth a visit. I really like the sweets and savouries being sold at the exit,1
Good place bengularans or outsiders visit this place. View and reply,1
This is a 'must visit place' for people coming to Bangalore or even for people living in Bangalore. The temple architecture has a distinct South Indian touch and very well maintained. When we visited (weekend/evening) there were not many visitors and the atmosphere was very peaceful. The adjoining land scape is under development which is giong to be on of the best garden in the City of Bangalore.,1
Nice place to sit in the evening time. You can find varieties of items. Atmosphere is peaceful. The architecture was awesome,1
Hare Krishna,1
This is truly a divine place that instantly gives you peace of mind. Very pleasant and Heavenly experience. Prasaad is just awesome and this temple is such a beautiful place. Jai Shree Krishna,1
More commercial than religious,0
Nice place of worship. Been a member since a very long time.,1
"A temple that is well catered for tourists. Good security, clean and well maintained. Good facilities to keep your shoes safe whilst inside the Temple. Can get bit tricky on a wet day.",1
"The temple is characterized by a combination of old and new. Thus, the whole area is very interesting. We were there one afternoon a week and were the only foreigners. The temple one can only enter barefoot. The shoes are made in advance. Similarly, you may release large pockets and the camera. Here we were skeptical at first, but once you go through the process once, the delivery of valuables is safer here than in other areas where you must include the valuables. Officially, one may take any photos in the plant. There are but few overseers, so you can make relatively good photos from your phone.",1
"Situated on Hillock and very beautiful temple..Unlike many temples this place is very clean and ambience is divine.The Main temple have very high roof with life stages of Lord Krishna is painted over it. But after darshan when one start to exit,has to pass across mazes of stalls with sweets,namkeens,spiritual books and goods etc etc and no way to bypass it,though it is not compulsory to buy. Avoid weekends as there is lot of rush.",1
"Peace place, well maintained near metro station Mahalakshmi",1
It's a must visit Temple in Bangalore. Lovely atmosphere in and around.. Beautiful structure too. Just love to visit ISKCON !!,1
Another one in the chain of ISCON temples. Very beautiful place with lot of space. And its location at some height adds to the attraction. One can have (good food) bhojan and bhajan at the same place. Must visit when in city of Gardens.,1

Good,1
"on top of a small hill and really beautifully built, the bhajan at the ending of the day is worth listining",1
One can visit the ISKON temple to see the beauty of Lord Krishna. I love the place to visit but somehow I don't get the feeling of being in temple.,1
Its a best place of divine. The calmness and presence of glory will keep you with positive energy.. god bless all,1
Visited during Vacations.The architecture is just amazing and the Temple construction is also very good. A very tidy and serene place.There is even Metro connectivity from Mantri square Metro station. Snacks are also available on payment of 10 or 20 Rupees.A Must visit in Bangalore,1
One of the largest temple and nice view and arrangement,1
Nice place to go.....very peaceful?,1
"The ISKCON temple is an iconic landmark in Bangalore, with an excellent temple, providing great food facilities and also supporting a lot of charity work.",1
"Been here many times... And I feel something heaven wen Chanting Hare Ram Hare Ram, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna !!!",1
Its wonderfull experience with my family. For me its religiously For my young ones its for short picnic. Every one can find their interest here. HARE RAM HARE KRISHNA RAM RAM HARE HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE,1
Very peaceful. Great place for chanting. Very easy to reach. One of the best temple of India i ever visited.,1
Marvelous temple with so much neatness. Entry to the temple is very systematic without any hassle. All facility inside the temple,1
Like all the iskcon temple they have maintain cleanliness and peaceful environment... The devotees entry and exit are arrange very nicely... Lots of shop and exhibition center and foods in between the premises of temple,1
This temple is one of the must visit place in Bangalore. Everyone should definitely watch the glory of the temple,1
"The darshan was good, the Krishna idol is awesome and the temple was cleanly maintained. But this is all until the main temple inside. Once you are done with the darshan, then enter the prasad/food junction, which is really crowded, and not well maintained. No management to handle the crowd there, people just rush through the food counters and the food is scrambled on floor, not cleaned etc. You'll lose the essence that you are in a temple that time. The parking is a big headache again, where in you have to walk to the other end of the temple after darshan, which is painful for elders. Lots of improvements required, and there is no feedback collection as well to suggest.",0
"Nice place, good visit but its not as good as the original temple in WB. Food is also not that good but evening darshan is best time when arti happens",0
"Every devotee of Lord Krishna should pay visit to this beautiful clean temple. Much unlike the indian temples, the Iskcon temple is not only huge but clean as well. Too crowded.",1
"While they do take donations, the temple is free and quite beautiful inside. They feed countless school children every day as well with a network of trucks. After the temple tour, you have to walk the gauntlet of commercial sales of religious nick knacks and sweets, however there is a short cut out for frequent visitors and there is no high pressure sales here. The restaurant called Higher Taste next to the temple is pure veg and quite good ( tried a la carte menu but they also have a buffet).",1
Have been there a number of times - nice temple that you can visit in Bangalore even if you are not all that religious.. pretty well maintained and overall the experience is very good.,1
good place,1
Peace of mind here,1
"It was different experience for me. Its totally preferred for believers The main issue I found is that, we have to wait for long time to get in and every sectors.",0
"Very nice temple but I don't like donation box , but they sell suvinior inside is good. Too many staIrs.",1
"We performed the Friday morning Abhishekam (Thirumanchanam ) to Sri Srinivasa Govinda Balaji. A great experience of spiritual, divine ambiance with the chanting of mantras and the Lord's darshan is hugely a blessing. .. Nethra darshan is a rare opportunity to the devotees to experience the Lord in our minds filled in divine submissions. ISKCON conducts every event and all the daily rituals in grandeur set in the atmosphere of strict adherence to the Aagama principles and punctuality is a standard perfection. The dedication seen in the alankaram of the Deities adorning the pleasing dresses is always a beautiful treat to our eyes and hearts on every occasion. Perfection in stich and fit is mesmerizing aspect and the tailor is greatly blessed to offer such services is a rarity. Prasadams offered to the Deities with great fervour and sanctity ensured in exclusive preparations in a secured environment and cleanliness of highest order. Devotees are equal in front of the Deities and the prayers are of soothing experience to the soul and one would forget the self while surrendering to the Lord totally with divinely attachments. The Akshaya Patra noon meal services, free Prasadams to every devotee after darshan and the Annadhana seva to the poor public are of highest quality and commitment in the minds of the Staff and volunteers. The financial integrity and transparency of accounting and auditing is of impeccable order and the public contribution is fully acounted to ensure its scrutiny of spend. Excellence in organizing and conduct of the responsibility entrusted to the Executive Committee is a good benchmark for public organisations.",1
went there for the first time and was amazed with the excellent architecture. I would suggest every traveller to visit this place atleast once.,1
very peaceful ambiance!,1
Beautiful place .,1
It's an eternal place. Love to visit again & again.,1
Takes out the aspect of faith and peace of mind as its all about Money...... Force selling is so strong that you might get more peace in a coffee shop where they lett you sit in peace for a while!!!!,0
"Beautiful temple with devine deities. the mangala aarti, and shayanna aartis are beyond material experience. The temple is well managed , clean and located on a small hillok called harekrishna hill. Can be crowded in weekends and special days. please visit for devine darshan of Radha Krishnachandra",1
Peaceful place in city life amazing architecture must visit place in Bangalore city .... evening lighting is good ...Prasad is very well prepared There is shopping mall in side it of bhagwan,1
"The temple is very pleasant and peaceful. Its a huge area. The interiors of the temple are wonderful! We went there on a Sunday. There was a lot of rush, but properly managed due to which we did not have to wait for long. We prefered the special ticket darshan which was very quick. All the people there are very helpful. One thing which I did not like there is- its too much commercialised. Once you come out of the darshan, there are people at every step trying to sell music, books, etc to you. They literally drag tou to the 'dhyaan' area for meditation giving you a mala in hand and forcing you to chant the mantra. This shouldn't be done by them. Once you enter the temple, there is no shortcut to get out without having a look at all the stalls. You have to go through all of them and the people there trying hard to sell things. The food in the restaurant was good.",1
They should avoid all the shops in the queue. Everybody will not be willing to buy things.,1
"Temple is excellent, some what commerlisled with their products?",1
"When in Bangalore do visit isckon which is just 10 min in metro from majestic station soon to be opened on may 2017,best place ,sacred place ,nice prasadam and beautiful Krishna temple,must recommended",1
Great place. A must visit. Excellent food and darshan of Sri Krishna. Weekends are a bit crowded. Soul satisfying.,1
"Going to this temple every year on my wife Bday , you will impressed with the cleanliness of the premises and the rich marble architecture . God darshan and bhajan atmosphere will take you to different world , enjoy the best by being calm and focus mind on your God you love within temple . The shopping outlets serve you the best quality sweets and bakery items and even lot of hand made crafts available . The prices looks more , but it has hidden charity events cost in if. Iskon need to be appreciated for the akshaya patra initiative , serving food for poor.",1
"It's one of the major tourist attraction in Bangalore. Very Beautiful temple and well managed. Though it might get crowded in evenings on weekends but on weekdays,its mostly peaceful.",1
"A wonderful temple that is worth the visit and within my short visit to Bangalore for 2 days, I managed to visit this temple twice just to view the day and night view of this temple (photo as attached) ...A million thanks to the temple management who is managing the temple well... I felt so peaceful and at serene while meditating in this temple... Every deity looking very divide and beautiful... This is definitely a must visit place while in Bangalore... (Note: no photography is allowed inside the temple premises)",1
I went to iskcon temple with my friends. This is a historical place of lord Krishna. It is such a wonderful place and peaceful place,1
"the great temple known for architectural bonanza is situated on top of a hill from where you can see beautiful bangalore.you get elevated yourself as you climb the hill and once you enter the sanctum sanctorium lo you really forget the world.here you will definitely say OMG! .Buy Srimad bhagvad geeta, Sri Bhagavatham, by Swami Prabhu Pada the founder of ISKON. On top it you will fulfill your taste buds by varieties snacks, north/south Indian delicacies ,sweets. Buy good souvenirs, enjoy life.",1

Good religious place very peaceful,0
"I visit the temple regularly, not cause I am a man who believes in God... Just for the reason going there and spending time chanting hare Krishna hare RAM and see the 'bhakts' dancing and enjoying is so soothing. This place is my point to go for finding peace. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r287018802-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
"If you don't have a lot of time, let the concierge know and you can get in the quick line. Unless you are planning to worship, this is ideal.",1
The place is the temple of Lord Krishna and is very big. You must visit this temple and also try of you can have the food in the mess next to the guest house.,1
The temple is really beautiful and we have been there during the evening time along with family had a great time being there.,1
The art on the ceiling and idols of lord Krishna is a great plus point to this attraction. Now this place has become more like a picnic spot wer u will get bakery to eat at the end of the temple. Just visiting once will be a good enough not frequently.,0
"I visited the temple on a recent study abroad trip. The temples were unique of course and beautifully designed and executed. I am still figuring out the best ways to appreciate Hindu temples due to the complexity of the faith and how the multiple deities interact, but it was beautiful. The most impact-full part however was learning about and getting to tour one of the kitchens of Akshaya Patra, a foundation that provides a mid day meal to over 1.5 million Indian school children a year. Their mission history and the thought they have put into their large kitchens with gravity fed rice cookers that can serve 1,000 and specially designed trucks to carry pots of food to schools within a 45 mile radius was so impressive. Makes you think about your privilege in new ways and my responsibilities to my brothers and sisters around the globe. Amazing organization.",1
"Good maintenance, no smoke inside the temple premises. Clean and neat. Must visit for Lord Krishna devotees.",1
"One find peace here, atmosphere is just awesome, well organized and maintained.",1
Supper and amazing place nice 5star,1
"ISKON temple Bangalore is situated in the centre of the city accessible easily from any location. The three tier temples dedicated to Lord Krishna in different avatars is a must see while visiting Bangalore. True to its identity, it is very clean, neat and divine. Piped music of melodious 'hare krishna hare ram' fills your ears and soul, stops your thoughts from wandering. Restaurants(2 of them) and mini shopping arcade are well stacked and economical. We had even conducted a family function in their mini hall. Catering arranged by ISKON was good. You can contribute to' Akshaya Patra' meal scheme for children.A scenic beauty and a tourist attraction with the blessings of Lord Krishna. What more can you ask for!!!",1
"A very beautiful Temple of Lord Krishna, Balarama & Radha Everyone should Visit and Experience the Feeling and Positive energy",1
supper,1
"We very much enjoyed our visit to this beautiful temple, a place locals practiced a ritual of worship, a quiet place but avoid the weekends in order to avoid congestion.",1
"It's all business, take a lot of money before you plan to visit there, guides will randomly catch you saying that the...",0
"This is one of the ISKON temples, but unlike other ISKON's you can pay here for VIP darshan. However it's not required if you are visiting on weedays or non festival day. Temple is clean. They say you should chant lord Krishna's names 108 times here. What I saw was that the people who came there were more interested in the canteen rather than the darshan The canteen serves scrumptuous north indian delicacies like Jalebi, gulab jamun, rasgulla. And you have to buy that",0
"Calm, serene and soothing experience, great place to spend a day",1
"Temple is really great.... U can eat varieties snacks,lunch....get lots of souvenirs from temple in Krishna's life...it's good to have in kids versions.... Kids will enjoy and learn our gods also...",1
"Hare Rama Hare Krishna is a beautiful Eco -friendly temple. In a valid boss, you will be more careful about security.",1
Big Krishna temple. Usually crowded. The prasad is great and lot of eating options in the temple. Very commercialized but nice for a visit,1
Very well maintained temple in Bangalore And the Statue is mesmerizing,1
"Beautiful .. especially the maintenance and organised for keeping your belongings and taking them back.It takes considerable time to go through the darshan . I was of the view it would take me 30 min, but it took more than an our or so . Want to visit it again ..",1
"You want to be away from the noises of the city and feel the calm and peace within, Iskcon is the place to go to. With its serene atmosphere and ever present chants and mantras, you finally find peace in midst the chaos.",1
"I went from Whitefield to Iskcon with my family and small kids. It was a fun visit. It is nice quite place, with books and literature on Krishna. The food that you get in the floors below the temple is really good. It is like a eat street like setup but the place is maintained and clean. Really enjoyed my day there.",1
Superb temple,1
Beautiful and Very maintained Temple. Best visiting time 5pm to 9pm,1

"Really a fantastic place to visit. Very serene, very peaceful and very clean unlike most temples.",1
commercial temple,0
I love to visit this place....,1
The temple is wonderfully built and its architecture and interiors are marvelous. The Prasad served is very tasty and wholesome. The only thing that I felt amiss is that the temple is too high and one has to walk a lot and climb many steps which is slightly distressful for aged people.,1
"Spiritual, divine, blissfull, variety, freshness and satisfying is - Iskcon Bangalore....and a place to seek some real knowledge of self , nature and God. I love it?",1
Beautiful temple..but lots of queue. Especially for shopping area..poor provision for handicapped and old aged people.,0
A pretty big temple with 3 levels. There are many well priced souvenirs found here too.Around the temple ground is a nice restaurant that serves good vegetarian food on buffet style,1
Unconditional Love for Sri Radha Krishna!Hare Krishna!,1
"We visited this temple.You have to climb some steps to reach in temple. Camera and mobile are not allowed inside temple. This is a glorious temple of Krishna,Balram and Subhadra in Bangalore.This is #1 hindu religious tourist place in Bangalore, DO visit.",1
Its too good place to visit in bangalore located in yeswantpur.Too calm place and it will give you lot of happiness by seeing the surrounding.Must visit this place at least once also. I have visited it more than 100 times still now and i still want to go there again and again because it will give lot of happiness and it will cool down my mind.,1
A wonderful place for being one with the divine. Opulence and grandeur on display. Had to pay for one row in front darshan where the crowd was less.,1
It is a pleasant place in the heart of the Garden city. Very well maintained in this Saarinen atmosphere.,1
"The ISKCON temple at Yeshwantpur is quite beautiful and dedicated to Narasimha swamy, Venkateshwara swamy and Sri Krishna. The entry is free and takes a long walk to enter into the main temple. Once you are done with the darshan, you will have to walk through the rest of the temple and it will look like a definite market but offers only Saatvic food. Pretty good place if you visit with your family.",1
"This is one temple where one is impressed by the sanctity of the temple, its holiness and its cleanliness. There are no beggars or middleman .The idols are beautiful to behold. Access is good for senior citizens and disabled too.",1
"We visit this temple very often. Decoration they make during festivals or any occations is beautiful. You can enjoy calm & peaceful ambience & go through stalls in the premesis.

Well maintained,1
Very beautiful temple and very quiet too. Well decorated and queue strictly followed. Eternal Bliss!!,1
I like the Lords krishna,1
The temple of Radha Krishna is worth seeing. The precious stone studded idols are amazing. The gold plated sides of the main altar with its intricate carvings is eye catching. The very high ceilings with paintings conveying the story of Lord Krishna is superb. One can buy the Bhagawad Gita by Swami Prabhupada translated into various regional languages. There is very tight security. The place is very cleanly maintained. Cameras are not allowed - but there are cloak rooms to leave your camera and collect them on the way out. A large number of steps need to be taken to reach the sanctum sanctorum - elderly people could find it difficult - but I think there are special darshan passes to avoid the steps (not sure - saw some signages about special darshan at extra cost). The bhajans are very soothing and captivates everyone who is around.,1
"I usually visit after the official work, before going home especially when the day goes worse. This place is a source of spiritual energy and peace . The place is to reenergize the soul. I recommend ppl to go in working days evening and stay there till aarti gets over. One will definitely experience the peace and positive vibes of lord radhakrishna. ..",1
"Decently calm & divine feeling when you visit here. It was my 2nd visit, after 9 years, and the place hasn?t changed much. Going uphill, you appreciate the cleanliness, discipline, architecture, aura & idols. Going downhill, you appreciate various eatables, and shopping galleries.",0
"Go there if you are interested in buying Krishna branded products. They are using name of Krishna to brand their products and make money. You can find Krishna statues, Krishna branded t shirts, carry bags, laddus etc there.",0
Very peace full Amazing service providing by the volunteers and staff more than that clean and tidy of that place will decrease all our stress. Program by name YOGA FOR HAPPINESS was such a nice a program that i haven been never.,1
Very big temple. With lots of lights and one would go amazed to see that colorful monuments. Very near to metro as well.,1
Nice place,1
"Best mall i have ever been, keep your hands up like the idol you will get priority to do anything",0
"Impressive gold shrine with deities and ceremonies. No photos allows inside. Pay admission, and to store your shoes. ?",0

"I feel a great satisfaction, good administration and discipline. It a peaceful environment and cleanest atmosphere.",1
"A place where you can feel the personal presence of Lord Krishna. A place filled with spiritual energy. A place where you feel like spending every moment of life. Words are not enough to describe my experiences here. You have to personally visit once, to know what exactly it feels to experience the highest form of divinity.",1
"A very beautiful temple dedicated to Lord Krishna. Clean, peaceful and very well managed.",1
We have been there with allour family members. This temple runs by ISKCON group and they have their own restrictions for the pilgrims. Jeans / short tops / knitted dresses / Leggings. strictly not allowed for female pilgrims. Be sure that you are wearing Churidars/ Sarees.. For male Shorts / Jeans not allowed. Inside the temple its more commercialised now a days. Whatvever you want to buy it will have thier own rate card. Ensure you have enough cash in hand. Overall the temple view and God is great looking. Have a great Darshan.,1
The details of this temple are impressive. The ceilings inside are elaborate murals with idols made with such intricate detail. Beautiful and worth the visit.,1
Very nice and very clean kept temple - amazing big inside very spacious and lots of people visiting. Crowed on the sundays.,1
2012 July visited,1
One of the best places to visit in Bangalore.,1
Hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare ram hare ram ram ram hare hare,1
"If you are looking for a traditional experience of temple there are plenty in Malleswaram or even right opposite of ISKON , the Gurvayurappan temple or the Mahalakshmi / Anjennaya temple in Mahalaskhmi layout. ISKON is clean, good ambiance (fountain) etc. Be prepared for a long waiting time during weekends. If you are looking for a package of temple + mall+ good food- overall a good time spent, yes, this is the place. All said about the commercialization (which is very regulated), the Aarti at 7.00pm is a moving experience. The chant, sound of music instruments and pooja gives you a peaceful, divine feeling. Visited June 2014",1
"Recently I visited this temple in the month of April,2015. That was 9th April evening time, when we reached at temple premises, there was a large gathering just outside of the temple. Some special occasion was going on at that moment. Temple was illuminated very nicely. There was a great procession of Iskcon Rath, road was over crowded & devotees...",1
Nice place to visit on a weekend which can combine both religious and attractions. I went along with parents & kids and both had something to look forward for.,1
"The emple is build to take all you attention away, but being a devoted Krishna follower, I like the bhavya mandir compound where the Radha-Krishna murthi is.Just sit and chant.",1
"the location is wonderful. the climb up is a beautiful experience particularly if you take the chanting route. just forget everything, shut your eyes and ears on all unnecessary things and visit this temple.",1
Great place and the architecture of the temple is so nice. Its called ISKON. This temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna. Super Place and peaceful.,1
Why Temple City --- Not only the Temple you will like its also the whole city you will get to see ....,1
"hare krishna hare rama !hare hare! this is just like the ISKON in Juhu Mumbai,but this is magnificiently maintained and darshan is hassle free. Men cannot enter in 3/4ths and have to wear a mundu if they have to get the darshan. wonderful experience.",1
The largest and most beautiful temple complex in Bangalore. Definitely worth a visit.,1
Good Temple to visit,1
I must say that many of the modern day devotional institution that exist today are just meant to attract people's attention and forget to bring divinity. ISKON is one among them. There are too many shops inside and hence I have to say this.,0
"As a visitor, it's worth going for the cultural experience, but you need to be ready for the relentless commercial atmosphere. As a foreigner, it starts early, as you'll be sent to one of the special lines that costs more but gets you closer to the statues. It's worth it to get the chance to talk to the priests, but once you're done, you need to negotiate a very long and twisting line filled with people trying to sell you things. The place is beautiful, and culturally important, and that makes it worth it. Just be ready. (Couldn't resist being the 1000th review. Hope I timed it right!)",1
"This is a very large and popular temple, so best to visit when it first opens in the morning. There is an attendant to hold your shoes, and be aware of the dress code before you go: long pants (no shorts) and no bare shoulders. They will have some fabric in case you need to cover up. Also, no photography allowed. The buildings don?t take too terribly long to get through if you?re just going for a look. It is beautiful inside. The main temple area is large and open, and there is a shop with books off to the side. As you?re leaving, you?ll pass by several areas with food for sale",1
"ISKCON, Bangalore is very peaceful place to have good meditation. ISKON is clean Krishna Radha Temple, must every one see.",1
This temple is big. The view of the main temple is amazing. It has a lot of options to eat after you are done with religious offering.,1
"My wife and I had our wedding here as well. Very clean and well kept environment. Good experience. Tip: If you're an ISKCON member, you can use your card to get a 20% discount on the stay and the wedding hall.",1
The place is very neat and clean.dharshan is also organized.but somehow I didn't get the feel of our old traditional temple. Ven pongal they offered was awesome and equals that is offered in traditional Vishnu temples. first time I saw a temple offering cake(of course eggless) as prasada. My kid who loves God radha Krishna enjoyed much the visit.,0
"This is one of the cleanest temple I have seen. The Arti was mind boggling!!! The snacks and food on the way down - arranged in small stall like set up - was just superb...... Packed some sweets and snacks from there and had dinner at their ""Higher taste restaurant"". The restaurant has 4 star level set up..... Served pure vegetarian ang (Higher) tastry food....... Enjoyed every bit of it. A model which many temples in India should follow...",1
"Temple timings:4:15 am to 5 am,7:15 am-1:20 Pm,4:00 pm to 8:20 pm.Buses to Iskon temple depart from platform no 6 from majestic BMTC bus stand,There are frequent buses from majestic BMTC bus stand to Iskon temple.A new bus service called Bangalore Rounds run by BMTC also covers ISKON temple in its itinerary.There is ample parking area for private vehicles inside ISKON temple complex.The temple can be added in things to see in Bangalore,as Bangalore city has no other temple of similar repute.The paintings which are like wall murals are good inside main temple complex depicting lord Krishna. After darshan of Lord krishna one enters to a shopping place which sells wood idols,photos, brass idols etc.There is also a shop selling organic products inside ISKON temple complex.There is a small theater which shows animated pictures on Lord Krishna for a fee.After shops selling souvenirs one will enter a food court area which sells foods like Bengali and Karnataka sweets,snacks like pakodas,veg rolls etc.One can also have ice-cream,cool lassi or badam milk...After all this one enters the place where free prasadam(food) is served,which is very tasty.Near the exit is a restaurant.All this is located inside ISKON temple complex.",1
Its a rich temple. Building is beautiful and big. Place is very calm and religious. Some shops/cafeteria are also there. Overall can/must be visited if in Bengaluru depending on religious orientation.,1
Attended a wedding function followed by a pure vegetarian meal served at and by the temple. A clean ambiance with spacious interiors and full privacy to the attendees. The food was at par with any good vegetarian food of South Indian origin. Clean and with fairly less spices as was expected. The surroundings were free from clutter and the temple premises has ample parking. Surprisingly the washrooms were clean and dry and quite contemporary. A suitable place for conferences and weddings etc.,1
"One of the best ISKCON temple, pretty well maintained, peaceful place, sweets and snacks are also available in temple premises, one can also shop for Radha Krishna photo frames and other handicrafts.",1
"Temple is excellently built up with idols of deities situated in the step manner. Also the ambiance inside the temple is relaxing and soothing. There are various options available with regards to pooja, darshan, aarti etc with various prices. Also it houses one of the best restaurants of the city i.e. Govindas and along with that it provides various options to shop as well. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r322535115-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
"one of the best clean temples around. finely structured tour , good food , good books collection , great people to talk and guide on.",1
"Very devotional,",1
Another nice place which you should visit in your life time.very devine and awesome experience.Recomended for all temple visitors. Visited June 2014,1
"Iskcon temple is a huge the,male complex in west off chord road. It not only has a temple but also a huge shopping centre as well. Very clean and well maintained.",1
"ISKCON temple is far away from city though, but still once you reach you will cherish your visit. The temple atmosphere is very soothing & calming (people can find a lot of peace here). My visit purpose was not divinity (though) but the beautiful & grand temple architecture and an awesome food court which offers a large variety of North Indian food. You can purchase a variety of cakes & sweets from there as well ( Plumcake is a must try) You can even purchase a variety of gifts for your loved ones ranging from clothes to mementos but they are overpriced, so better avoid it. Must visit once if you are in Bangalore.",1
it was indeed very serene and huge. u need time to visit this mandir. Darshan were excellent but you should opt for family pass vip entry.,1
Its a must visit place in Bangalore city. Especially very nice for its architecture. The place is very calm and devotional.,1
Really good ambiance created here...lovely setting for a peaceful walk..,1
"Modern temple dedicated to Lord Krishna..food, market, books, animation movie (20 minute), laddu (Prasadam), availabl...",1
"i often visit there with family. it is definitely worth a visit during arti time. the enchanting of songs, dancing of all the devotees, the prasadam after visit, everything is great. also, they have a huge cafeteria which you will pass through as you are exiting. there is also a 3d movie hall with some animated movies for kids. They have restaurant inside the temple also which is very famous for its food.",1
Nice place of worship. Been a member since a very long time. Very clean and good place to eat too. But it has become too commercial.,1
The temple is well maintained and has well decorated and bright sanctum. Visitors are made to walk around the stalls which sell ISKON merchandise which makes it more like a walk in a shopping mall than a place of worship.,0
This temple is huge and on many levels. Really worth the visit but the thing that let it down for me was how much there was for sale at the end. It was just too commercial and simply a money maker for a holy place.,1
"Organised, clean and not expensive r300 entry. It is quite a process to buy a ticket, get a shoe storage token, hand bags in and navigate the complex system of barriers though! The temple gives a great view of the surrounding area and is busy and interesting. It is rather a 'commercial' experience though, with pressure to sign up to direct debit donations and buy books, toys and food. Apparently it is only a decade or two old, where I was more expecting a more historical building when I first went there!",0
"It's a very awesome and very peaceful towards the nature. If no one has not gone yet than, please go and see you will definitely like that place.",1
"although the temple is good but I personally felt that it's a pure money making business in the name of GOD by the temple staff . However, the God will never judge his followers by the financial status but then his protectors are discriminating the people in such a way . That's a shame",0
Commercial Temple,0
ISKCON Temple at Bengalore is the largest and best temple complex among those constructed by the ISCON.The huge temple is mainly dedicated to Radha Krishna .It is 6 km away from bengluru railway station and 30 km from bangluru airport,1
"It was my second visit to Iscon, sitting on top of hill its a beautiful place to viisit during evening. Calm, neatly maintained.",1
Clean but commercialised.,0
I felt truly blessed visiting this temple. We had to chant all the way up the queue. The surrounding was also good. Later we went shopping around in the complex and picked sculpture of Lord Krishna.,1
"It is a cool place to spend time with family and offer puja. Calm and beautiful, ISKON Bangalore is a must visit for people coming to Bangalore.",0
It is Hare Krishna temple worth seeing.Very huge complex of temples The idiots are gold plated which looks amazing..There is very good shopping area inside the complex where one buy goods at very reasonable price .the canteen is also very good,1
"After a Disney-esque amount of shuffling up and down barriered lanes of queue, we were pushed through the actual praying and puja element of the temple at breakneck speed and then immediately whisked round the corner to be accosted at length by salesmen trying to get me to offer all my worldly goods to the building of a new and bigger temple, and then marched on to the gift shop. Which when you're trying to teach your three tired kids about the sanctity of religion, kind of takes the biscuit. It's spiritual in the same way that Wal-mart is spiritual, and there are a hundred smaller, more peaceful and less showy temples in Bangalore that are far satisfying to the spirit.",0
"Beautiful well maintained place...those who are going to bangalore must visit this place..huge iskcon temple compares to others...the place is very peaceful...we went from Chennai and were were lucky to see a video which showed t road from Chennai to Bangalore...the title was ""Chennai to Bangalore | Full road trip | Video with GPS ""...it will to helpful to everyone who wants to visit Bangalore iskcon ....must visit this place at least once in lifetime...i am pretty sure that if once visited we will be wanting to visit this place again and again..will be visiting this place in this month again...",1
we went on a Saturday and it was very crowded however the crowd was managed properly. Big temple compound. idols of god are good,1
"A clean and well organized temple experience. No vendors, touts or beggars harass devotees. No one asks for money. Try taking the path which has 108 tiles on which you take steps while chanting ' Hare Rama Hare Krishna' one step at a time. You forget all your worries and tension in the 10 min that it takes to enter the temple. After darshan you can enjoy melodious bhajans. As you exit the temple, shops offer books, souvenirs and eatables. Free prasad is distributed to every devotee. A must visit in Bangalore.",0
Pleasant atmosphere,1
"i follow root given by google map from my room at Bomanahalli, BLR. I took lest time to reach there.",1
"I visited this temple in January 2016, more as someone wanting to eat at their fine-dining restaurant - The Higher Taste. This is a modern iconic site, a must visit site, whether you are a devotee or not. There is parking space available and the visitors/ devotees are taken through the temple through organized queues. There is a low-cost eating joint as well as a fine-dining restaurant. The place is well-managed and is also involved in a lot of charitable work. Their famous charity is providing free cooked lunch to school kids studying in many Government schools under the brand AKSHAYA PATRA. This scheme improves attendance of school among kids from economically backward families. The hot lunch is cooked and delivered to the schools using a fleet of vans and trucks.",0
One of the best and the most magnificent ISKCON temple I have seen till today. Would not suggest visiting this place during a festival as it becomes very commercial and crowded with lots of food shops inside the campus. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r289459579-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#,1
"The time taken to reach this place after long queues is well worth it. Once you enter inside, the experience is great. the chanting of bhajans and the music simply lifts your soul. Great place for buying merchandise.",1
"Very nice temple & peace....,",1
"Beautiful temple, located in Yeshwanthpur, around 8 km from Railway Station. Amazing place for spiritual unwinding. One can have wonderful Darshan of Lord Krishna here. Temple is maintained well and is very neat and clean. Quality of food offered as prasadam (Annadana) is too good. From other reviews, to get more clarity : 1. No body here forcing us to chant: ?Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare? 2. Also there is no Entrance fee. 3. Temple timings: Monday to Friday: 4.15 am to 5.00 am, 7.00 am to 1.00 pm, 4.00 pm to 8.20 pm Saturday, Sunday & Public Holiday : 4.15 am to 5.00 am, 7.00 am to 8.30 pm",1
"Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare",1
The temple is very nice well organized you will get Darshan easily and spend time.if you are interested in devotional books you will get very good collection you can get organic food very tasty and pure.,1
"Best time to visit Sunday evenings around 5,6 pm, you can enjoy Kirtan and dance by devotees.",1
Jai Raadhe Raadhe Raadhe... GOVIND Raadhe... Gopal Raadhe......,1
Most amazing place.. best centre for devotional services..,1
Best place for peace praying,1
"Nice temple and well worth a visit if in Bangalore. Very well managed and beautiful interiors with gold statues. On the way back, you come across stalls selling nibbles , books and artefacts. Nice way to make a bit of money for the upkeep of the temple.",1
Architectural beauty,1
"Solace for the soul. An awesome aerial view of the surrounding city. The ""prasadam"" is hot and tasty. Good vegetarian stuff is available for the hungry.",1
Very good place to find peace. Very good atmosphere and clean place. And specifically i love the people murmuring hara rama hara Krishna sound a amazing sound come to ear,1
"Visited June 2016.Our good Indian friend took us to visit Iskcon. One funny thing he forgot to mention though was that we had to walk barefoot from the parking lot, all the way to the temple. We didn't mind it though. A tip, leave your shoes in your car instead of leaving it in the repository as there are too many visitors and you risk losing your shoes or getting them mixed up, alternately you can stuff your shoes in your bag. Bring some wet ones to wipe off your dusty feet after the visit. The temple was majestic. Intricately designed all over. Going up the main staircase gave us a view of the lower parts of the temple, the roofs stunningly encased in gold! Inside the temple, we got to sit in the middle of a group of meditating and chanting visitors. Truly gave us a positive vibe. As we exited the place, we were led to a small bakeshop where all authentic Indian sweets and pastries were sold at cheap prices. We also liked the souvenir shop with the quaint books and trinkets.",1
"I had visited temple in less c rowdy time One of the largest ISKCON temples around and one of the busy temple too. Modern Traditional temple, clean and built with amenities which lags in most of the temples. No wonder more popular among the foreigners. Large place and be prepared to walk up and down the stairs in a line.great view place too, enjoyed the place",1
Heaven in Bangalore,1
It's very easy to find our locatins,0
Nice,1
"This temple looked more like a small mall to me than a temple. As you enter you will have to undergo severe layers of checking and after that you have to climb many stairs to reach the main temple. Once you have had the darshan you will be made to walk through all the different stalls they have which became tiresome for my aged parents. You will also be given prasad after you finally come out of the temple. The main shrine is however beautiful and you can offer pushpanjali also by paying some amount. The time we went the temple was very crowded however the management was good and we did not face much issue. Also by buying some special darshan tickets you can opt for skipping the crowd. Another thing the temple had a dress code board on display which said ladies wearing only saree, salwar or kurti would be allowed in....however we found ladies wearing jeans also going (though they were few in number).....however one girl wearing three-fourth was stopped at the entrance.",1
The hilly location of this temple adds to its beauty. The view of city from the top is beautiful. Parking is ample and convenient. Tip: Leave your footwear in the car. This will save time and footwear will be safer. :),1
"Management is very good and temple is so beautiful ,clean. Meal is very tasty and reasonable price and animation show memorable.",1
Lord krishna in different forms is seen here. The sprawling temple is a wonderful getaway in the busy schedule. The canteen also serves delicious food.,1
"If you want to go to a temple which is clean, where people go for darshan in line, the atmosphere is filled with chant, you can sit in the main hall for few minutes, and marvel at the architecture too, then this is the place. Please watch the temple hours and time your visit for a better experience. We visited it on Friday after the new year, darshan was immediate and we could have some reflection time in the main hall listening to live chants. Great food choices available as you exit whether you want prasadam or a snack or more. There is a shopping area with costumes/clothes, gift articles, Sri Krishna photos/replicas and much more. Depending on what you are seeking in your visit, you will have it. I heard it gets busy on specific days such as Ekadasi....so do some diligence before you visit.",1
"No words to define the divinity of the place. Have been here more than 8 times. Just love the place!!!!!!!! Must visit for all interested in a bit of spiritual experience with beauty, calm n serenity.",1
No words to describe the feeling; it only needs to be felt,1
"When you enter, you will find a old guy with long Tilak on his forehead. He is a good sales man. He will show you 3 different prasad scheme. If you refuse to select anyone of that scheme then you have to go to general line, which will take 1-2hrs to reach main temple, up on hill. But I had choose Rs.300 scheme, which offers you following things 1) 2 ladoos as prasad, which you can bring with you and can share with your family/frinds. 2) they will give you Rs.80 coupon. If you want to buy from bookstall then this will be use as redeem coupon on total bill. 3) you will be a part of Aarti. 4) You will be in VIP line. Which only take 20 min to reach main temple. I was convinced by last point only all other are like accessories. This was their business part. Now when you enter to main temple, suddenly your behavior and mind will change. Atmosphere is pleasant. Photography is not allowed so .. I liked thier Bhajans so instead of buying books I bought CDs for Bhajans . I recommend to choose any offer of that sales man.",0
Very nice. I want to see again. Very neat and calm,1
One of the best spiritual place.,0
"I have visited many ISKCON temples in India, but this one beats them all hands down. The sheer size and vastness of the complex takes your breath away. As you move upwards from one level to the other you are absorbed in the magnificence of the place. Of course the opulence of the temple at the highest level ( which houses the main deities ) is something to take away for a life time. The ambiance is very elegant and graceful, but the crowd presence in large numbers, kills the serenity of the place. One apparent and slightly disappointing aspect of the place is that at every spot ( waiting halls, passages leading to the temples, prasad hall, .. . ) there is a visible attempt to market the products and other offerings from the ISKCON establishment. At a place of worship a very open and slightly overdone display of this type of marketing - is a little uncalled for. Overall, a place one must visit if it Bangalore.",1
Nice place,1
Temple is located near to orion mall. infrastructure is good. Easily reachable by metro and buses. And even the food is also good. Good sighseeing if you visit bangalore Visited October 2014,0
It's a nice temple to visit. I have been there couple of time. I suggest to visit late evening and stay till Aarti. They do awesome Aarti with Hare Krishna hare Rama chant everywhere. Only part I don't like is it is highly commercialised but then at least no one pushes you to buy any stuff out there.,1
"I often, visit Iskcon temple. Temple is divine beautiful, Calm your mind with Hare Krishna Chant in the background. Temple is very neat and Clean. You will get the blessing of Lord Narasimha, Lord Balaji and Finally Lord Krishna (main temple). No words to express beauty of God. One should not miss this place. While exiting, you will find book stores, few youth programs and get to see film theater they play movie related Krishna story/life cycle story. Once you cross theater, you will find temple related materials, food items. Once you exit from the venue, they issue Prasadam(Pongal) it will taste yummy. just love Iskcon Prasadam. Photography is not allowed inside temple. However, you can take photo once you exit from main venue.",1
"If you're a traditional religious person, this modern cult temple may seem like a well-maintained museum to you. But go with open mind, and this is a nice, clean, beautiful shrine on its own. At any rate, this Rajajinagar mandir is worth a visit.",0
Temple programs doing very nice and perfect,1
Holy Devin place. If you are in Bangalore and have not seen this temple yet then please do visit and get the blessings from hare Rama hare Krishna.... Beautiful temple,1
"You get a lot of positive vibes while you enter the temple and Visit all the small temples and finally reach the main temple on top of the Hillock. You can Drive up or walk up not very long queues, except for the festivals. I suggest walking up since its difficult to get parking inside the temple sometimes.",1
This temple is more commercial than divinity. The temple is meant for people to pray not to see the fancy aspect of god.,0
"This temple is surely not for a non-beleiver. We went there in the evening, but we were not able to visit the temple without participating a crowdy ""pooja"". It is not a good practice, if the temple is for all kinds of visitors.",0
Didn't feel divine of any sorts..... But construction is a worth watch.... You can hang out in a group and spend half a day?,0
"Very neat and clean gardens, calm, good architecture... The temple has portraits of Lord Sri Krishna and prasadam is ...",1
"ISCKON Temple Bangalore is located several kilometers from the city center and is a 'bone of peace and serenity in the infinite chaos of this city .The temple offers ample Darshan of different structures, lecdivinit√° are beautiful and are held many activities The guest house is of high level, the srrvizio great, the attractive price for citt√°.Come all temples ISCKON is extremely clean and the devotees are welcoming and kind, ready to help anyone Inside there are several places where you can eat the wonderful sacred food restaurant the complex is really interesting high quality one of the best I've tried in India I recommend it",1
It's superb,1
"its just like a another Iskon temple, good place to visit for peace. Disappointed a bit with too much of commercialization.",1
I had been with my colleague to this place. The temple and its premises are very clean. Crowded but this place is good to be.,1
very devotional and inspirational place. Ravishing beauty. Clean surroundings and very helpful people who help you all the way.,1
"This is a wonderful place to visit, where you will experience the ecstacy of the divine love of Lord Sri Krishna.This is my experience as i have been visiting this Temple every year on my birth day for the past many years. Stand before Lord Krishna for five minutes during arthi,you will forget yourself and start dancing to the rhythm of Bhajans going on continuously.The temple is on a natural hillock in Rajajinagar extension,built with a blend of modern and traditional style. This is a place you cannot aford to miss to see the Bhakti movement/culture of Hindu tradition.",1
Nice place of worship....one of the big temple.,1
With out Bajanas it would be very nice place .,0
"It's iconic temple, very peaceful & quite Place, little Buddha are so cute looking and good place for inner peace, lots of greenery, Prasad is so tasty, good to visit with friends and family. Do visit once you will never regret.",1
One of the best temples i have visited. Well maintained and has lot of breathing space in the busy city,1
Perfect all arrangements,1
The best thing in this temple is the Prasadam and the last Aarti of the day. The view from the terrace before the Main temple Stairs is awesome,1
It's very beautiful place and u have to see atleast one time.. That much I can say.. That's it..,1
"We were not informed that we could enter the premises with our car from a different entrance so my mother had a difficult time climbing the never ending steps through security, shoe collection etc. The whole visit has been made so clinical that the spirituality is lost ! http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r322829706-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",0
Its been a wonderful experience being at Iskcon Temple got the spiritual energy and peace of mind the place where you can find the personal presence of lord Krishna,1
I was there for the morning aarti darshan. I felt really mesmerized and felt like being in Heaven. No words to express my feelings. You have to be there during the morning aarti to feel it ..,1
"It is a temple however you feel you are in a resort. There are rooms available and different Mantapas also available for celebration. We got married there so I have a soft corner for this place. It is worth visiting this ISKCON. There are lots of option for vegetarian to eat from the shops that they have. There is a restaurant called ""High Taste"" which is also very nice. You have a buffet option and it is not exorbitantly expensive it is okay to spend for your family if you want to have good food. The food here is yummy. You can be a member of ISKCON. The best part is if you have a celebration and the estimated guests do not turn up the food does not get wasted as it goes to Akshaypatra. So please do visit it I strongly recommend it. It is a landmark and a must visit place of Bengaluru.",1
Like most of temples in India this place is too highly commercialized. Families would love it though.,0
super temple,1
...iskcon dwarka ......Yaha mandir k andar bhi stall laga rakhe h..... or prasad k naam p .... 56bhog prasad ki MRP. ko seva ka naam diya jata h ....jo paise dega use hi prasad milega. ..... this is totally wrong. ... ab darshan k sath sath prasad bhi Sale hoga wo bhi mandir k andar......,0
"Beautiful temple but with a catch at the end of your visit as there is an incredible push for donations (as a foreigner you are taken to a separate table in the back where the ""speech"" will start) Visited November 2013",0
Excellent Place... Opulent ambiance... A clean temple.. that's new,1
You feel positive and spiritual when you are in shadow of Krishna!!,1
A very well maintained place. I am a religious person and I went here with my family because I had heard so much about this place and it happened to be close to where we were staying.,1
"A fine example of how a temple can play a role in our life Divinity - serene and simply fantastic Simple Q system, paid and regular 1 feet away Feeding the souls and bottomless bowls Spiritually uplifting classes, programs Cultural oriented cultivation with captivating classes Showing Satvik food without onion Garlic is tastiest All senses attended to with magic of Lord Krishna HARE KRISHNA",1
Peaceful place to visit and you will enjoy the beauty so i will suggest everybody to visit here nothing much,1
Nice place,1
"My wife and I stayed overnight at Iskcon specifically to witness the early morning aarthi and abhishekam. The stay was wonderful, people were nice and the prasadam at the temple was delicious. The 4:15 a.m aarthi was out of the world. This was a great experience for us. We had a 4 month old baby with us also along and she too seem to enjoy the stay.",1
I have visited ISKON temple many times during my stay here. What I love is the way the crowds are organised. Every one gets a good darshan. The other good part is that they have a nice food court set up in the premises and then the HIgher Taste which is amazing. It is a good place to go to with family and friends.,1
Perfect Oasis for Spiritually Thirsty Souls. Hare Krishna,1
A Lord Krishna Mandir with amazing environment,1
This place is the ultimate stress reliever. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare...maha mantra relieves stress and infuse positivism.,1

Amazing architecture. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Bangalore. Looks good in Night. Five stars.,1
This Temple is good but lot of confusing path to reach to main hall. Main Hall is extremely beautiful.. it is one of the must visit places if you are in bengaluru.,1
Beautiful temple. Good environment. Great experience.,1
"It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world.The temple is a huge cultural complex that was inaugurated in 1997. There is a gold-plated dhwaja-stambha (56 ft) high and a gold plated kalash shikara (28 ft) high. There is free distribution of Sri Krishna prasadam to all visitors during the darshana hours.During my visit I got veg pongal as prasadam and stamp size photo of Lord krishna. ISKCON Bangalore has six shrines: 1.Radha-Krishna. 2.Krishna Balrama. 3.Nitai Gauranga (Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda). 4.Venkateswara 5.Prahlada Narasimha. 6.Srila Prabhupada. The exit way after the Darshan from the main temple leads through a series of shops that offer books on Sri Krishna in all the possible Indian languages. Various shops which offer astonishing range of merchandise can also been seen giving away bags,pencils,compact discs,rings,cloths and many other things all having a mark or a photo of Sri Krishna.Apart from these things, there are various shops which provide eatables of large varieties including laddoo, cheese cake,samosa,milk shakes,pakoda,rice bath..... The overall view of these markets provide everything that a devotee visiting a temple would need. Temple is very well maintained. Must visit, multiple times. Had a great experience God bless Hare krishna hare krishna. ......",1
Didnt felt spiritual here. Seems like only business is in the mind of people who are in the temple. I would say its a Business Center.,0
There is nothing to say about this temple... anywhere you visit you will feel peace of mind and the same I felt visiting here. It is situated near to Mahalaxmi Metro Station.,1
Chants of Kinshasa with peaceful aura comes in every moment u spend in temple. In temple u can buy quality snacks. Try coconut barfi.,1
Nice temple,1
Nice to visit here Enjoyed it,1
Awesome!!,1
"Place is filled with chanting "" Hare Rama Hare Rama Hare Rama Hare Hare, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare",1
Nice place to visit...specially Saturday and Sunday evening...iskcon conduct chariot of lord krishna,1
Nice place to visit. Avoid it during weekends due to rush. A nice place to have peace of mind. The area in which it is located is bit crowded. So plan accordingly,1
"Located in Rajajinagar, the place is easily accessible by public transportation. A proper weekend visit with family, friends or couple. The area is vast with very well maintained systems. I loved it.",1
"ISKCON temple is same like all ISKCON society well maintained, lots of parking, they collect slipper/shoes upon arriv...",0
"I went with my wife on Sunday afternoon... kindly note the temple opens from morning till night on weekends and on holiday. Place is kept very clean.. There was continuous stream of devotees..they have a provision for special darshan..Rs.300/- per family ..max 6 people. This entitles one to bypass line, go very close and provision to sit in front of narasimhaswamy idol and venkateshwara temple. Also to attend aarti in main Krishna shrine.+ 2 prasadam packets+ rs70/- worth books free/discount. Food- lot of option in food court on your way out from main shrine at affordable rate..one hotel offered buffet south Indian at Rs.180/-. Merchandise- you can buy wide variety of items like photo, incense sticks, idols, clothes, oil etc.",1
"Pluses: 1. Location: at the end of west of chord road, close to Orion Mall. Metro station (Soap Factory) makes accessibility easy. 2. Hill Top temple. Built on a hillock, it gives you an ethereal experience climbing the stairs to reach the temple. 3. Temple: With chants of lord krishna reverberating in the background, its a peacueful experience to visit the yoganarasimha and balaji temple on your way up the hill to the main Krishna temple. The main Krishna Temple is huge hall with golden idols. Awe inspiring, peaceful. 4. Krishna memorabilia: on your way out of the temple, you get an opportunity to purchase Krishna theme products : books, collectables shirts etc. 5. Free Prasad: They provide free Prasad of Pongal ( Khichri) which is very good. They also distribute free lunch prasad coupons 6. Restaurants: They have a premium restaurant in the temple complex which was closed when we visited. You also have an option of going to their dining hall and having a basic meal of Rs 75 ( rice sambhar sabji and papad). There is another small restaurant where you can get Poori Bhaji and a rice dish. 7. Parking: Adequate parking space for 4 wheelers at Rs 30 8. Great views: of western bangalore from the top of the hillock Minuses: 1. Footwear stand: there are 2 places where you can keep your footwear. Slightly confusing Final Verdict (5/5) Serene , peaceful and rejuvenating place",1
Very beautiful temple.. Evening aarti and palki is beautiful.. Must visit once..prasadam is also delicious,1
"Though the place is highly commercialized but for the services to run, its justified. The place is host of many tiny delights with the aura and the food served is delicious.",1
"Superb... Quite ,clean and peaceful... Plenty to shop and eat too....Must visit place in Bangalore. Hare Rama Hare Krishna",1
Iskon is great,1
One of best place to visit in bengaluru.,1
One of the best temples. Which will automatically dip you in spirituality right from the first step to you reach the temple,1
A must visit place .Its very near from Yeshwantpur bus stand or IISC,1
"A beautiful Lord Krishna temple,worth seeing.Very well managed.",1
Beautiful Mandir neat and clean .Food are so tasty,1
Great atmosphere,1
"To start with, the place was very clean inspite of the area it covered. People there were very curtious and were ready to listen to you and help. the Statue of gods are exceptionally done and very well maintained. the Prasada that you get to buy are very good and moderately priced.",1
"Olympian, peaceful & holy place.",1
"It's huge and well maintained temple like most of the ISKCON properties around the world. The only issue here is crowd and long queues, so keep some extra time at your hand if you want to go there.",1
Had great opportunity to visit the temple . But it was embarrassing to see lots of gimks and marketing inside temple . Its was more of shopping center than peaceful temple . Disappointment,0
This place is very amazing.....feeling peaceful...that was very wonderful feeling in violence.,1
"We were at ISKCON for the morning Darshan. It was a soothing experience. As it was a sunday morning, there was very little crowd at 7 am. We had good aarti darshan and very pleasent experience - be it parking, shoe-keeping, darshan, prasad etc. It would be good if you can be here in morning and have experience ISKCON is famous for..... Visited October 2014",1
"The temple and the surrounding areas has been maintained with a very good ambience, inspite of the high crowd there. Good place to spend an evening",1
"This is one of a kind place. If you want to spend some time with family and if temples are a choice, this should be the first in the list of choices.",1
Really beautiful place to get enlightened on Holy Shri Krishna. The morning darshan is especially soothing to the mind. Saatwik food and prasad is a great delight to see,1
"I stay in Bangalore. I had been to this place twice. this place is perfect family tour. Things to do : Visit to temple, varieties of materials related to puja items, lunch by akshay patra. My suggestion : reach this place in morning 11:00 so that you can get enjoy the lunch by akshay patra.",1
"Visited this temple during a business trip in Bangaluru and found it to be a very impressive temple. Not only regarding the construction and the way you have to climb your way higher and higher, but also due to the tranquillity found over there. Shoes need to be stored against a small fee and also if you carry bags and camera's this needs to be stored before you may enter the temple. Entrance is not free for tourists, but is worth to pay. Ignore all stands after you've visited the temple as this is very touristic and to my opinion not worth to pay attention",1
"If you are coming to enjoy than it's a right place . It's more like a shop, Didn't imbibe any devotion in me.",0
a Visit during Aati time may gave you Goosebumps and feeling of Love towards God. Must try prashad and souvenir area,1
"Good and Peaceful place to visit at any point of time all around 365 days. You can go with family, friends and Solo too.....in one hour you can finish the visit but I don't think if anyone will go there and come back in one hour. You will feel like be there itself...",1
"Imagine having chinese food without onion and garlic and pastries without egg-this is the place to visit.Besides south indian food ,the chinese noodles with gobi manchurian was very tasty.Hot malpuas and other icecreams were the highlight of food at this place",1
This is a good temple for Radha & Krishna. The interior is covered with Gold .... The main entrance way to sanctum sanctorum is made bit lengthy queue complex which could be avoided... There are so many temples and it is one among them ... This is owned by ISKCON .. Visiting here is at your choice... This is only a temple ...,1
It awesome I am very happy to visit iskcon with family,1
"The temple is a magnificent structure to behold as you drive up to it, and the interior decoration is really stunning. The visit piqued my interest in learning more about the Hare Krishnas. Some reviewers commented they were pushed to give donations but I did not encounter this. I paid 300rupee for the tourist / ""fast track"" path around the property which was worth it for me as I could not stay for too long (you have to follow a set one-way path around the grounds). Really enjoyed the market attached at the back of the temple where you could buy delicious sweets for 10rupees apiece (not sure of the names but pretty sure samosas and gulab jamun was there), all sorts of souvenirs, clothing items & religious literature. The temple also provided visitors with a free bite to eat, some rice soup cooked in line with sattvic principles which was delicious. A very interesting and enjoyable visit. Visited July 2014",1
Good,1
"Krishna-Chandra Temple, ISKCON Sri Radha look at the. Take picture, then the ferry would equal to where it needs to go. Abgeebn shoes, and barefoot always the way of the snake-binding Rauss in the temple and again. But is very impressive",1
Place where we get peace mind and can worship Lord Krishna directly. Good place and can spend hours in front of Lord Krishna. Beautiful Temple loved visiting it..... Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare hare... Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare....,1
"hare ram hare krishna, its holy place and situated on the hill. awesomn experience. with family had great experience",1
Hare Krishna all deewoty,1
"The place is a pain to check out, with high-reach staircases and excessive crowding for what ultimately ends up being a letdown given all that you've been hearing about it. The architecture and the construction however, are impressive.",0
The ISKCON temple is a beautiful one. You can sit here for some time doing meditation. There are fountains in the evenings which add beauty to this place. One can have snacks and ice-creams too. A calming and fulfilling feeling.,1
I live opposite to this temple and have contributed in my own modest way to its building. What we love is the serene atmosphere created by inclusion of Gaushala in the premises. They have a canteen and gift shop as well. The main temples houses Lord Narasimha idol on the ground floor and Lord Krishna avatar on the first floor.,1
"Paid parking - Check. Multiple restaurants/cafes - Check. Souvenir shops - Check. Theater - Check. People taking selfies - Check. Young couples cuddling - Check. Somehow this was not my idea of getting spiritual vibe. But people flock to this place and like it - so I guess I am the odd person out. My advice - if seeking temple architecture or spiritual experience - this place is not for you. People are encouraged to buy ""paid darshan"" - but it is not required and most of the times - queue in ""free darshan"" is very small. Good things - Food in restaurants beats quality and taste of most starred restaurants of Bangalore. They have wheelchair access (something unheard in most Bangalore), free (clean) bathrooms and most crowd is decent and well behaved.",0
RELAX PLACE....!!! HeY RAm Jai KriShNa...?,1
"Beautiful temple with superb paintings inside the temple.One has chant hare rama hare krishna before visiting temple.After doing darshan one can do shopping for idols,photos, books, dresses, bags . Also there are so many counters for snacks and variety of food items.Good parking space available in the temple premises.Its a must visit place for outsiders. Visited March 2014",1
Beautiful,1
Iskon visit is part of HO HO Bus City Tour. The place is magnificent and a lot of gifts and eatables available.,1
There were 3 temples in the campus. Huge space. Tasty prasadam. Parking: available. Photography not allowed. We attended aarti there it was good. Crowded.,0
"Hare Krishna hare hare . Slogan will be heard every where . ISKCON Temple is a beautiful Temple which attracts each & every one .Temple is on the top of a hill which has good nature . Entire city view is visible from the top . Sri Krishna is main God . Sri Anjaneya Mahalakshmi, Sri Venkateshwara temples are near to it .",1
"It is a good place to visit if you travel to bangalore and while it is a temple , it has a big eat out place with lot of veg options so you can plan the sight seeing accccordingly to ensure you lunch or snack is also covered.",1
Really great tempal god is great,0
"This is a must visit for temple lovers. I would recommend reach early i.e before 10 a.m if you would like to utilize the Iskcon parking. You would need to deposit your footwear and buy passes before the darshan. For elderly it is recommended to go for VIP passes, especially for folks with knee problems/ problems with climbing stairs. Post Darshan, you will walk through their in house store - selling various goods like malas, gita, toys, clothes, eatables, pooja items and so on. At exit you would be handed prasad (mostly halwa or khicdi) on leaf bowls. This is yummy. Post all of this, you have option to go for free lunch (not that great, they serve rice, sambar, rasam, curd, one veg) or go for fine dining (@ Higher Taste Restaurant) In short, it is a good place to spend half a day with your family.",1
Peaceful place. Arati is the best.,1
Love this temple,1
"Gives a peaceful mind n clean atmosphere ,makes heart lighter n feels like heaven on earth .the charm of Radha Rani n...",1
Most peaceful place for me in Bangalore. Whenever I feel low I visit ISKCON and I'm all good in a few hours. Mainly because this place is so divine and situated on a hill. The breeze will have a refreshing effect on anybody going to ISKCON. Visited July 2014,1
I just loved it...I m blessed to be there...& I love to visit once again... Morning aarti was just awesome..,1
"This temple is one of the earliest examples of successful commerce being promoted under religion that I have witnessed. To be fair, many other temples are just as crowded and reeking of money today. I have seen a few Birla Mandirs and the Swamynarayan Temple at Ahmedabad - two examples that came to mind, which are clean, orderly and peaceful with very little evidence of the importance of money. But if you look at the other reviews here, you will notice that they too have felt it is a commercial place like a mall, or a place of entertainment where you can also buy things. Somehow, every religion seems to popularize the notion that spending your money at places of worship is of paramount importance to reinforce your spirituality. Currently I pass before this temple almost every day and am witness to the number of gullibles trudging up the steps. Someone is selling it to them as a tourist destination of religious importance. Big time. I can only say this temple has arrived a long time ago and is still selling.",0
This place is a master piece!! It's jus wow and the place is so silent and it's so divine and the god idols are such a beautiful creations and the place is so powerful for those who believe in God!!!,1
"The place has a nice religious ambience for Krishna devotees, but there is a commercial aspect to it if you would like to buy some of the Krishna memorabilias, religious materials. Teach the kids about the value of donation on their birthdays and make to see how such religious activities spread the value by free food for the needy and other uplifting activities performed with the help of donation. Just another experience and learning for the kids.",1
It was a beautiful temple .. should go once.,1
definitely not for south indian devotees...seeing this temple you will not have the feeling of being inside an temple since the entire architecture and their attitude makes you feel as you are inside an mall for shopping...they just try to milk your money as much they can,0
This is on a small hillock facing Yeshvatapura-Chord road.The temple is neo-classical in style and quite luxurious in its conception. The puja is very traditional but in Nort Indian style. The idols of Radha Krishna are also in North Indian style. Devotees who are invited can partake the evening's Prasadam and others can make enquries at the office for this. Car and two wheeler parking is no problem The temple also has a beautiful restaurant in the premises. In the evening culturlal programs will be held at the adjoining auditorium.The temple with its landscaped garden is very well maiantained and cleanliness everywhere is given maximum importance. Wheelchair is also available for aged and infrim people. All in all the temple is a unique experience.,1
"It looks full devotional while going, but looks full commercial while coming back. There is food court inside the temple",0
"Its an amazing feeling when u visit the temple. Really when you enter, one of the devotee of Lord Krishna will give u a Lord Radha Krishna's different avatar pictures at one side and the Maha mantra of life on the other side 'Hare ram, hare ram, ram ram hare hare , Hare Krishna hare Krishna Krishna krishna hare hare '. So, for entering into the temple, there are 108 slabs where u ll keep ur every steps and ll have to chant this Maha mantra. This is the time, when a divine and sacred feeling will automatically come into ur heart. And its the starting and when u will see the Aarti, u can't imagine and I can't express what u ll then feel in ur heart ..... U really will feel such as you are at God's place ... N rest you will experience when you urself visit...",1
"I had being to this temple several times with family. You feel something different when you visit it. Avoid visiting during peak days as it may not give the feeling of calmness and space to view inside the temple. Lot of parking space is available and do not park outside premises as it may towed area its kind a busy area since Yeshwant railway station is next to it. Also for shopping Orion mall is near by and if you have Metro wholesale card, is just next to the premises. You have walk up to the main entrance and there are lots of small temples on the way up. For senior citizens and parents will small babies, there is lift available near the parking area which takes you to the main temple. You can ask to the parking staff about it. Also good variety of food is available inside the premises which is always tasty :). To reach ISKCON, should not be headache as anyone can take bus which is on the way to Yeshwantpur from any location of Bangalore city. Note, there are chances no direct buses are available and you can change buses from Majestic or Shivajinagar bus depot if required. Must visit for people you wish to see in and around Bangalore. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r316497982-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
"The temple complex has a beautiful Guest house, very well furnished, well maintained Rooms with courteous staff equipped with dining facilities catering divine Prasadams . Persons who are life members as well as Dharmadhikari's are provided free accomodation for specific periods. More than all these, the enchanting spiritual environment echoing chanting of ""Hare Krisna...Hare Krishna..."" takes you very close to the divine feet. Early morning Sacred bath to the deities should not be missed. Devotees will not get this experience any where else. We stay every year at the Guest House to enjoy this blissful environment.",1
Recently on 9th March I visited this temple with my family. Temple area very beautiful. Rooms are quiet clean and well managed. Architecture of the temple was great. It is kocated centerally near Yashwantpur Railway station. prabhu parsadam so aromatic and tasty also.,1
Avoid visiting on week ends as the place is over crowded and no parking facilities available during week ends,1
"This place, ISKON Sri Radha Krishna-Chandra Temple is one of my most favorite places in Bangalore. We visited this place several times along with family, friends and relative. A MUST see place in Bengaluru. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r299097288-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
Isckon temple is a place to visit in bangalore and never miss it. Here ull find the peace n the vibration of god. U will never want leave this temple. The mantras here are always on n clean ur soul seriously.. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r287034482-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#,1
We had very good darshan of the Lord on the eve of new year. People at the front desk were helpful and assisted us to have a quick darshan as we had to leave Bengaluru in a short period.,1
You will feel the lord sree Krishna here. A must visit template in Bangalore.,1
Nice & quite place.,1
eautiful and clean entrance provokes you to a serine and very peaceful place of sitting in front of god. I feel like to forget whole world out side once i sit in front of God. I will suggest don't miss evening ARTI it is so peaceful and i don't have proper words to suggest but i wish you should be a part of that arti procession. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r268431918-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#,1
excellent place visit in Bangalore. however place will be crowded but not much. get to see lord krishna. lots of varieties of snacks just before exit of the temple.,1
"Its is one of the most beautiful structure's of the iskcon temple, spread out well with a great height ,it s a tribute to all of iskcon temple for its grandeur and beauty , Its composes of such majestic beauty with a spirit of joy, beauty ,peace and love.visiting the temple is a treat to one s soul, with its fantastic indian vegetarian restaurant is a must",1
Very nice temple. Well connected by metro and non ac bus. Need connectivity by ac buses too. Iskcon is well organised. There are people to collect footwear and keep it safely. The veiw from the top is amazing.,1
Good place nice prasdams.Very gud place for meditation.best time to visit in evening.... Its One of the cleanest temple I have visited. Very calm and quiet atmosphere. It fills up the air with the chanting of hare rama hare krishna all over..,1
Looks like a commercial place rather than temple. Too much congested during weekends.,0
"The best experience is in the evening - be in the temple by 7:30 PM. There is an elaborate pooja & a colorful, lively and high-energy Palki Darshan, with people dancing and playing music - you can join in too. Round this off with a great dinner at the excellent (if upmarket) restaurant in the complex, and this makes for a great outing as well. There are lifts (escalators) for the physically challenged / lazy people. However this Temple is best enjoyed by fit people.",1
"I have been there with family. Nice place to visit, if you want some peace. On weekends, there is a little bit rush, however it is not like how it is during Holi Festival or Krishna Janmasthami. I have availed Rs. 300 pass (which is valid for 6 adult people).The special pass allows you to visit the deities from near as well as they help you to perform puja for you (you can provide your name and gotra). Also, pass gives you as many prasadam laddus as there are adult people (like if you visit 6 members you will six prasadam laddus) as well as it gives a discount of Rs. 70 on any book purchased from there.You can stay there as long as you want and spend some time in meditation as well. While going out you can find various types of items - decorative, ornamental, clothing, food items etc - which is entirely from ISKCON related stuff. One more thing, do not forget to pick your free prasadam of pongal (a.k.a khichdi).",1
"The temple premises is huge making for many spaces to sit and soak int he serenity. The architecture is also great and worth the visit. However, the shops really push you to buy stuff which seems odd for the temple environment",0
Very nice ISKCON temple. Huge temple compound. Awesome idols of god. Good stuff for shopping and eatables.,1
It was wonderfull to darshan radha mandir.i thought it might be similar to juhu temple but i was wrong.such a systemetic n no pandas were behind you,1
"The temple and the idols in the temple are beautiful. if you take the normal pass, you've to go through a long queue with chanting Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, and its lot of fun. but if you dont have much time, then go for the express pass and you'll able to get the drashan quickly escaping the queues. Food can be bought and has decent taste.",1
"I have been visiting ISKCON for a number of times in past 5 months. It is The Place for your weekends after having a hectic week from work. You find mental peace and a great ambiance with lots of devotees visiting the palace, yes I mean it when I say Palace, its none less than this.",1
dear all my friends very good place in Bangalore tank you to hotelier and car driver we are relay happy for trip,1
Hare Krishna..hare Krishna.. only word gives all the strength and energy.. this is place where we can get good knowledge on bagavad Gita,1
Awesome Temple I love this temple a lot an KRISHNA TOOO,1
"Being residing in Bangalore I never visited this pace , so thought of visiting this temple on my birthday . The parking area is horrible as if we have come to some rural place . Everyone told us to visit dis place 4 sure but nothing was revealing there. A huge crowd dats it. The Main temple had a big que to have Darshan. It is as good as a normal temple with huge space where nothing is der. There is a restaurant der , I didn't go der , but atleast if u r hungry u can munch something there. People who are eager to see this place should visit after 6 pm so that u can see the lightings n fountain there. Just a one time watch .",0
"Staying in Bangalore since birth, I had never visited ISKCON temple. It was my first visit in 2015 that left me staggered. The place is no doubt too huge, well-maintained and calm. But what surprised me was the big display board with the prices for some offerings or prayers, the loooong queue which we could happily escape by entering from in-between through some influence which my friend had and most importantly the exit way in the building which is filled with shops selling eateries, books, CDs and other stuffs. One might feel that all the things I mentioned above will be there in most of the temples, why exaggerate for ISKCON, again, it's what I felt when I visited and purely my opinion. So you might or might not feel this as commercialized temple. The God's idol/statute is not in the south-Indian style but is that of North-Indian style, i.e, the white idols. The hall is huge and nice. One thing that you shouldn't miss when you go to this place is to have food at 'Higher Taste'. It serves pure jain food and taste justifies the name of the restaurant.",0
Good place but then still its same every....place and money and they will bring god to you.....,1
one of the best and cleanest Temple in India.,1
Biggest Krishna temple in bangalore,1
Temple is situated close to yeshwantpur and has great environment and its a definite visit in bangalore. It will easily take 2-3 hours inside the temple to complete one round. Temple is very well maintained and you can find lot of souveniers to buy inside the temple. Visited February 2014,1
ISKCON shopping mall don't go there for Puja path ...... Just go to see the recipes of Puja and their prices starts from 500 to 50000 . ... I am shocked.....,0
Really a nice place .,1
ISKON is the only place which gives me complete mind peace. I keep visiting the one which is there in my hometown. Every weekend evenings I'll be there. Whenever my heart is heavy I go there and I get some kind of relaxation.,1
looking for nirvana.... visit ISKCON. Excellent location and arrangements. clean and serene atmosphere. feel closer to HIM,1
Visited this temple on a Sunday evening. It is crowded but very systematic and peaceful . Very good vibes and have very good prasadam also. If someone is looking for good bhajans and peaceful Darshan....this is the place to visit.,1
Hare Krishna! Temple with commercial touch..,0
"ISCKON temple by its name has always been a tranquil place with beautiful idols of Lord Krishna and serene ambiance. Living upto its name, ISCKON Bangalore is a fully divine place to be. You can spend hours sitting there watching the architecture and decor or you can also delight yourself with delectable delicacies they have towards the exit part of the temple ranging from Gujarati khaman to kulfi and jalebi etc, that too at a very cheap price. They also have a handicraft centre with pretty things to buy and also a store with religious books, CDs etc at a very nominal cost. I would love to visit here during a grand Puja/Bhakti event.",1
Must visit place when you come to bangalore. The temple is so neat and clean. Its very silent and the folks are very nice and kind. Luved the decoration and the temple with great Idols of lords and they conduct traditional pujas. The Prasada is yummy so is the food at the food court.,1
"Giant temple for Lord Krishna. Nice ambience and in a good location, right in Mahalaksmipuram. Don't miss this place when in Bangalore.",1
"Having a touch of South Indian temple architecture,this is such a grand temple complex.Situated near Yeswanthpur station,its a must visit attraction.",1
"It's beautifully built. Peaceful environment. Well maintained. You find many stalls when you are about to exit, which indeed takes long time to exit. Delicious prasad. Well connected by bus and also by metro(Mahalakshmi metro station).",1
"Very nice place, Every weekend I prefer to go Temple. Early morning aarti is like heaven come in earth. If you have plan to come Bangalore please visit once. It's awesome experience.",1
"i often visit there with family. it is definitely worth a visit during aarti time. the enchanting of songs, dancing of all the devotees, the prasadam after visit, everything is great. also, they have a huge cafeteria which you will pass through as you are exiting.They have restaurant inside the temple also which is very famous for its food.",1
"I have been there ISKON temples in pune, delhi already. last year i got chance to visit this temple with my parents. the place was really beautiful and quite. the entry was quite organized. you can easily spend 2-3 hours there by sitting. if someone needs a quite place in bangalore to read his favorite book then this place is best.",1
Hare Krisna Hare Rama,1
Very well kept and huge temple runned by the Hare Krishna movement. Great food and handcraft connected to the temple.,1
"We have been to ISKCON temple, we have bought for 300 rupees (3 persons) tickets. With this tickets we had some kind of VIP access, and that made everything very nice to visit. If you are in Bangalore don't miss this out.",1
"Just i saw iskcon temple , Bangalore photos on google i am eager to visit which will this monday 14th dec photos are awesom",1
Elaborate structure. Good queue system. Run professionally. Easy to navigate. Great food options. Organic food store. Occasional interesting events.,1
Great experience to be there Felt blessed as such as god resides here to bless you . The divine power let you feel it?,1
"One of the beautiful tourist spots in Bangalore city. Once you claim the hill you get very good feeling of being in the beautiful temple, maintained cleanliness around the temple, and also mouth watering prasadams. On top of the hill, you can experience the good over view of the city around the Temple. A place to visit.",1
A great place to visit in Bangalore. A bit commercialized and modified to suit western people but still a must visit in Bangalore,1
Disciplined and well maintained.,1
One of the beautiful temples in Bangalore. Very neat and clean. Highly Devotional. Hare Rama Hare Rama Hare Krishna H...,1
"Obviously everyone knows about ISKCON. In this temple premises we found another deities as Lord Venkateswara,Prahallada Narasimha,Srila Prabhupada,Balarama along with the main deity Radha-Krishna.",1
"In Bangalore, Iscon temple is a place to be for visitors, the temple is nice and well maintained. The view from there also very good.",1
Too crowded. Not worth visiting it. better be at home and prey to God rather than spending time and getting restless. It is too crowded and you will not get to see God even for few minutes. If you are really looking for peace of mind then stay back at home and do meditation and prey to God in home. Atleast you will have peace of mind.,0
Great experience,1
Good place for peace,1
"This is one of my favorite place in Bangalore, although the products are little expensive they are fair as the products are of high quality and taste, they offer prasad which is even more tasty and few tiny cards of Lord krishna",1
Devotion blended with luxury. Modern marketing and management skills are applied on devotees to spread Krishna consciousness.,1
Wonderful time to spend our important days like my daughters birthday as well as our wedding day... great occassion with great place to celebrate this with Lord Krishna's blessings !!! Prasad of Krishna -- No Match - it was excellant,1
Excellent temple....,1
Peaceful place... Well maintained ambiance. Must visit,1
Very subtle and scenic location. Recommended to connect with your inner self at any time This place has a great historic recommendation,1
"A well maintained Temple, I had ever seen...",1
"A Holy place to visit in Bangalore. Generally crowded. On the Hillock, on Chord Road. There is also a Pure Veg Restaurant, where you can get great meals, but a little bit on the expensive side.",1
"The ultimate place in Bangalore ,located in yeshwanthpur .I like it and i frequently go there",1
Nice views,1
"Decent, disciplined and very large temple complex in a very busy Malleswaram area of Bangalore. Clean, well organised place of worship and return path is full of eateries",1
One of the best places to devote Ur chilling evenings to on a fine weekend. Beautiful Radha Krishna sculptures and murtis. A must go fr a Bangalore visited person,0
It takes immense pride in letting know all regular visitors that I was involved in the initial surveying work of this Iconic structure way back in 1988 & this happened to be my first assignment of my career. This is a must to see place whoever visits Bangalore. The Akshaya Patra started by this organization is a grand success in the field of feeding hot food to all children studying in Government Schools. The restaurant at the temple complex serves delicacies which are mouth watering.,1
Good place to visit. Nice food . Clean and calm. Maintained the calmness. Queue system is well taken care.,1
Hari Hari Bol,1
More of business than divinity,1
Shrikrishna govind hare murari he nath narayanay wasudeva,1
"Very beautiful Temple, u will just love it",1
i haven found anything more peaceful than the early morning ..mangal aarti at iskcon. you can just surrender yourself...and feel super peaceful.,1
"The temple itself is reached after a security check. There is no photography allowed in the temple, although I did see people using cellphone cameras. The temple itself (inside) is quite ornate with a lot of gold decorations, but it is not old. What spoils the visit for many is the fact that in order to leave the visitor is forced to snake past many food counters, book sellers and souvenir sellers. For those who wish, or need, a free bowl of dal is offered very near the exit. Leave your shoes in the car or check them, as you must visit barefoot. There is parking on site.",1
"Beautiful temple. Probably the best tourist attraction in Bangalore. Allow for two hours to make it through the passageway of shrines. There's lots of food options at the very end. Be prepared to leave your camera, backpacks and shoes at the entrance.",1
A must visit temple in bangalore.....one of the cleanest temple I have ever seen in India...situated in yeshwantpur....this one is a beauty,1
Amazing place mind blowing no place as serene as Iskcon Bangalore Shri Krishna's abode,1
Very devotional and anyone coming to Bangalore must go here once at least,1
"We had a very good experience in the huge temple. Everything is so well organized here. The best place is purchase of small toys, eatables and books. A must visit if you believe in Lord Krishna and if you are visiting Bangalore. Happy praying!",1
"I have been to this beautiful temple twice and it just gets better.The place has a lot of beauty and charm to it.look within to feel the divine. The place takes you to a world of some wonderful architecture, intricate carvings and idols which is a reflection of your mind. Feel blissful in the ambiance. Maintained very well and extra...",1
"Nicely put together, clean, good for both hindus and non-hindus. Well organized, very busy, Staff is very courteous",1
"Very well organized with orderly queues, no shouting and manhandling, common to many temples of india. Pleasant and you get a sense of calm and brotherhood.Lots of parking space, which is a big plus point, in crowded bangalore.",1
"My experience about this temple: 1- No camera, no shoes. With the special entry I paid I left my camera in the security which they provide you a receipt to retrieve it later) 2- There is a special entry that you play about 1000Rupee. With this special entry you can walk through all levels easily with no line up. I recommend to pay the special entry, at each level your entrance will be much more easier and you get closer to the scene as well. At the end you get a few gifts from the temple. 3- Far from the Bangalore center. But if you are planning to go to the Orion mall then it is a good plan to visit this place and then go to the mall which is close to the temple. 4- I couldn't have a nice view to the fa√ßade because of some constructions was going on. So somehow I missed the nice view of the temple. 5- it is a culture place as well, like many other places in India. Also they provide free food to those in need. However at some point I felt it is like a shopping mall just to make money. 6- The whole path and the system to follow up going step by step to the top floor is interesting, but wasn't amazing for me. 7- They are well organized.",0
"Artificiality can be felt on every steps of this commercial premises which is known as RADHA KRISHNA- CHANDRA TEMPLE. In the name of Hare Krishna institution sells books, photos and so many artificial items. Well organized FOOD MALL have more crowd than main hall. Complete absence if divinity.",0
This grand temple near to yashwantpur railway station is a must visit for all Shri Krishna devotees. Even if you are an atheist you can visit this place for awesome vegetarian food within 100rs.,1
a very clean temple. nice feel. not like other temples this temple has its own charm. don't visit on janamastmi if you don't like crowded place. but its worth once.,1
"Nice place to have meditation, get Darshan from lord krishna every day so many people are coming from different place in the world",1
"On reaching at ISKON temple, we felt like visiting a religious(may be spiritual not sure) under the wrap of the corporate taste. In the evening we witnessed the ""aarati"" and the ""prasad"" was really very tasty. But the place is very much well guarded and protected.",1
"I am very happy to visit the Temple, very calm, I forgot all my problems, you can see all religion people come here",1
"I do keep on going to this temple on regular basis, every time i go there i just wish to be there for some more time. I feel near to god and the place is so peaceful. If you are coming to bangalore do keep this place on your list.",1
Another indian holy place..!! where you can visit..!!!,1
Nice Temple,1
It is very popular Lord Krishna temple. Few Tips: If you are going weekends or some special/festival day (Like Krishna janmashtami or Ekadashi) then it will be very crowded. You can buy the special ticket for speedy darshan. You must taste the food in the restaurant in the temple. It is worth tasting. You will not get that taste anywhere outside.,1
"While reaching the main gate of temple in rajajinagar our driver guided to hurry up, We rushed into the main gate because temple will be closing around 1 Pm, security people allowed us inside it was very nice and peaceful environment, while visiting the temple main hall, bhajans and chanting hare Krishna hare rama will make you a peaceful mind. temple closed around 1 Pm While coming back had seen people are selling photos and small idols of Lord Krishna with other books and toys had also scene fresh sweets and snacks selling in very hygienic environment we had launch as prasadam sponsored by a well wisher of krishna devotees, it was nice relaxed refreshing mind while stepping down from the temple",1
Hare Rama Hare Krishna,1

"The whole ambience of the divine place, the architectural beauty, the lovely touch of spirituality...one has to be there to experience every single moment of grace!",0
One of the famous ISKCON temple of India. This temple has its own history roots from 1996. A calm and peaceful place.,1
"On 30th March,2015 around 16:30 hrs , When I got the opportunity to have a glimpse inside the divine temple of Sri Radha Krishna Chandra, I remained stunned. I felt a divine peace inside this temple premises which was beyond imagination. The place was so beautiful and well maintained that for a while I felt out of this world. I strongly recommend any one who plans to visit this southern cosmopolitan ( silicon valley of India) city to keep this place in their travel itinerary.",1
"Opulence and grandeur, two words best describe the sanctum. Long lines and human paraphernalia managing things inside are not welcoming, but gazing at the The Almighty creates a lasting impact on all souls.",0
"It's a must visit place if you are in Bangalore . It gives a sense of satisfaction when in you are in main sanctum of the temple .But wait , the moment you start leaving the main temple to go out you have to go through numerous different types of stall which are basically rented out to sale food, clothes...",0
One of the BEST TEMPLE to visit in Bangalore .,1
"Loved our visit to the temple. Felt closer to the almighty. Very well managed and cooperative and helpful staff and volunteers make your visit especially with elders peaceful and comfortable. Not much preference given to big shots and no asking for money anywhere. You can contribute voluntarily by purchasing things at the shops on the complex. We were a group that had many elders and the staff supported us by letting us bring the vehicle to the top, using the lift. Good arrangements for seniors even on a very crowded day on which the beautiful rath yatra was bring held.",1
Wonderful experience....do visit once in a life time...!,1
"Nice and clean Holy place , a temple of lord Krishna managed very well by ISKCON group .Ideal place for getting peace of mind amidst the Bangalore town",1
Has visited the temple quiet a few times now. It surely is one of the very good places to visit. The only problem which i found out that there is a variable treatment for people to let inside the temple. I thought that was not a good tactic for money making.,1
"The ISKON temple is definitely worth a visit. Sitting atop a hill, the architecture is an interesting blend of the modern and traditional. You climb a series of stairs and once you enter the sanctum, it's a beautiful sight to behold. There are beautiful painting from the Bhagwatgita and you can spend time admiring these or in contemplation. Once you leave the space and get to the exit, you are unfortunately hit by a relentless array of shopping and food, which I felt was a little too excessive; but the fact that the funds are generated for the upkeep and the numerous charity projects, is probably a reasonable reason to excuse the same. On premises is also the Higher Taste restaurant, which specializes in Satvik vegetarian and is recommended",1
Very good vibrations.,1
"Good experience, visited first time the place is very beautiful.",1
Not at all good. If u going for shopping you can go there difference is here you will found spiritual things.,0
Super,1
We went with full family to Iskcon temple near to Yeshwantpur Mantri Mall and enjoyed like anything.,1
A religious (shopping ) mall.,0
Iskcon is a very good place. We will sought to see Lord Krishna's Leela's cleanly portraied through drama . Must visit place in Bangalore,1
"Facilities, Infrastructure, arrangements are very good. 5/5. But this temple is too much commercialized. if you have money, you will get priority for DARSHAN which is 180 degree opposite of the concept of the temple. for this 0/5.",0
"The temple is a huge structure with the usual soothing and divine aura that a temple has. However once you have had the darshan, you willl slowly find the temple transforming into a commercial center, with lots of food and shopping items. The place is highly crowded with long queues. When I went there with my family it was 3:00 in the afternoon and we had to wait till 4:00PM for the gates to open.",0
God and mandir ko dukan banake chor diya wow awesome lovely.,1
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare,1
The magnitude of this temple and the marble is impressive. The cleanliness is also a refreshing change from other temples in India.,1
"Sometimes you need to visit certain place for public demand. This visit one of such a kind. Being a Baisnav (Followers to Krishna) family this temple holds a special place for my family. Photography is not allowed inside the temple. All modern amenities are available, parking is available. Inside temple ambiance is good. Food is available; also you will get many souvenirs as per your choice. The temple is quite clean.",0
Nice & peaceful place..,1
Lovely wonderful,1
This temple is one of the must visit places in bangalore for its unique beauty and arrangements. The temple is located on top a hill and the view of the surroundings from the temple is awesome.,1
"Its always a good idea to visit this place at least once if you are planning to visit Bangalore. Its huge and architecturally a great structure, well planned and executed. Old people with knee problems should give it a miss as the number of steps are too many but that is purely due to the hilly nature and crowd management. Everything is systematic, right from depositing your shoes, hand wash and crowd management is awesome till the main temple area.(Though I didn't like the chanting on each step). Once the darshan is completed, now starts the real fun, chaos and mis-management. The temple suddenly turns into a food court, shopping mall, selling you t-shirts, paintings, souvenirs and snacks. Sometimes you find people loitering on the floors making it difficult for you to walk and food crumbles attracting flies and ants. A complete mis-management here. Its always a tourist attraction and yes I have visited the place more than a couple of times just due to the demand from different family members and my attraction are the snacks and sweets served there.",1
It was a sight-seeing day and we visited the ISKCON Temple. Very beautiful temple and well organized rules and regulations.,1
MAST hai managment MAST .mahaprasadam .jitna Mann to khao.,1
Nice place...please visit with the family in the evening hours...it gives immense pleasure....definitely do chant...hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare.....hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna krishna hare hare for 108 times...stay blessed!!!,1
"Biggest ISKCON temple ever i have seen, very clean & wonderful environment, testy food, quality shopping as well",1
"I found this place very peaceful and beautifully constructed. The colors are very pleasant to eye and the idol of Lord krishna is a beauty, one should never miss to see.",1
This temple is typical ISKCON style temple. very good quite place. I visit here almost once in 2 weeks.,1
"ISKCON Bangalore is a multi-storied, huge temple. Similar to the other Hare Krishna temples, you will get to see mesmerizing depictions of Hindu gods & goddesses; the environment is filled with the Hare Krishna chants reverberating throughout the temple complex. The temple is generally quite crowded on weekends; you should plan ~2-2.5hrs to cover the temple. Do check out the timings of the temple before planning a visit. Arti at the temple is an amazing experience that you may not want to miss. Prasad, and food, is delicious (like most ISKCON temples).",1
Pockets of vaikuntas where supreme lord sri Radha Krishna Chandra and his Devotees resides,1
This place attracts devotees from the entire world. i see a lot of foreigners visiting this place. The food court sells the best sweets and also the best egg less cake. This place is best to visit in the evening.,1
"World famous ISKCON temple - Lord Krishna resides, offers blessing to his devotees, surrounded by flowers, garden situated in top of mountain tops. Beautiful place, great construction in recent times. You will hear HARE KRISHNA mantra all over the places in the temple. Certainly you feel the peace in your heart. Pros: Parking facility Varieties of vegetarian food available Great scenic view of Bangalore You can do offerings to god Cons: Wear religious dresses. I heard they dont allow lungis, shorts, leggings, modern wears Crowded during religious important days and weekends Not for: This religious place is not for hangout, time-passers No-nonsense people Surrounded by: Great transportation, accessibility, great to reach Movie halls, Malls, shopping places, eateries",1
The temple is located at a wonderful locality with blush greenery. And the essence inside the temple its a treat to watch and feel the glory of Krishna..,1
"We Indians are used to seeing dozens of temples in very city, but only a few are well designed, efficiently administered and expansive. Almost like a private commercial enterprise, the ISKCON temple in Bangalore can change your perspective of what a modern Indian temple can be. I have visited ISKCONs in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Boston... This one has to be a mile above and beyond any of them. It also houses the world famous Akshaya Patra free meal kitchen which has been featured in National Geographic's TV series.",1
Very good place to visit. Calm atmosphere. Worth visiting. You need to deposit your shoes before entering the main premises. Usually very crowded on weekends.,1
Lord Krishna temple a very big famous in Karnataka. Everyone must see,1
"Among a lot of temples in Bangalore, I found this temple to be ""Different"" - Very well maintained, Clean & Organized Temple complex. Plus Points - * Clean *Peaceful Atmosphere * Location: Very well Connected * Good Parking facilities Negatives - * Too many commercial activities which Ideally does not suit a Temple environment",1
Hare Rama Hare Krishna. temple of Radha Krishna. World famous ISKCON organization. Lively clean and peaceful atmosphere. Parking and locker available. Nearby mahalakshmi layout metro Photography inside Is Strictly prohibited,1

Very good place,1
Been to ISKON 3 years ago and it was an amazing experience. Took my friend there this July and he loved it too. Unfortunately it rained so much we didn't get the chance to experience to step by step mantra to enter the temple.but it was nice. A place I would visit again when I go to bangalore ... http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r301345468-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#,1
High tech temple,1
Beautiful temple,1
"Amazing place for you to find peace in the busy city....You'll feel a divine connection to yourself the inner universe which is inside you..... Very big structure, clean, and spiritual.....",1
"Abode of Lord Krishna , Nice. Ambience, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare. Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare",1
Good worship place in the city.well maintained,1
"It is a great place to visit. Very clean with nice environment. Whenever we get visitors at home (Bangalore), we take them to this temple. However you won't get the same blissful feeling, what you would get in Tirupati or Badrinath or Dwarka. One needs to go with the right expectation as a sight seeing place. Also, meditation is tough in the hall due to crowd at intervals. On ISKCON festival days, while the rush is huge, it is a must visit place.",1
Awesome spiritual place,1
hare Krishna hare rama .. I with my husband loved to stay here. so calm so peace..it simply cnt be described by words.,1
Please visit on weekday Weekend is very crotasty Recommend you to eat khichdi very very tasty Transport needs to be changed from majestic,1
JAI SHRI KRISHNA I can devote my life for SHRI KRISHNA?,1
"Beautiful hill top, serene and calm place always reverberating with Hare Rama Hare Krishna chants. As always ISKON maintains its premises very clean and neat. I have been a regular visitor to this temple, starting from early morning, mid day to late evenings. Apart from divinity, the place also offers excellent vegetarian food in its on premises restaurant.",1
Beautiful temple with amazing architecture and attention to detail. Was very original in its design with little annex rooms scattered around. Emanates very positive energy. Worth a visit!,1
Hare krsna hare rama.moks ka dwar he.,1
"Very good temple, very good vegetarian food made with organic ingredients, I was surprised to see the temple clean and nice",1
ISKCON TEMPLE IS ONE OF THE BEST AMAZING TEMPLE AND GOOD ENVIRONMENT IN BANGALORE .,1
"I stay quite near to Rajaji Nagar where Iskon temple is located hence it?s a must visit for sightseeing when we have guests at home. Temple complex is very well designed and huge in space. All the facilities are very well maintained such as Parking , Prasadam ,Audio Visual facility to reflect the history of Iskon and soverniours stalls. We get to see firm believers of Radha Krishna around chanting ?Hare Rama Hare Krishna? that gives a very positive feeling.. Must visit if in Bangalore. Temple opens for very short time in day hence go in evening after 4 pm.;it looks very beautiful when illuminated.",1
"Whenever you are feeling low...just visit this place. This place is beautifully made, very clean and very well organized as well. Jai Shi Krishna.",1
"I am sorry, but I actually didn't feel like I am visiting a temple.. It was pure commercial gold/ gold plated idols and some interiors.. You are forced to go through a line after visiting the idol, where there are many sweet shops, and I have seen people buying laddus, thinking it is prasadam.. and after this, you will be routed to the end, where you can see people distributing free prasadam.. I would rate this as a tourist attraction, rather than a temple.. People come to visit it, as most of the tour operators take them as first place to visit in Bangalore.. Nice and well maintained.. Although, I went to this temple 4-5 times, but it was only to guide my friends/ family.. Sorry again.. I didn't mean to hurt anyone..",0
"nice temple to get peace of mind to avoid problems , the temple construction is attracts you ,very big temple , best to go in the evening ,if you go in the evening for temple you can enjoy the view of Bangalore city.",1
"Wow. Peace can never be an exaggeration. You sit quietly inside the temple hall and just look at the magnanimity of the temple architecture all draped in marble. But the richness though does not take away the eloquence and the soul of the place. And when you consider the meandering narrow road to the entrance of this temple, you can help but compare it with the hardships that we need to endure before we rise to meet the One. There is enough car parking space atop the hill. The roads have been planned and well maintained here. We had a great evening watching the city scape from this hill.",1
Its a very nice place to experience. The temple is very well maintained and managed. Definitely worth a visit in Bangalore.,1
"Divine experience, peace of mind, everyone must visit",1
The temple is well cleaned and maintained and situated will within city and accessible all the time from every corner of the city.It is worth visiting and one can rejoice there spiritually.,1
"If you want to relax and stay away from the chacotic Bangalore life for some time please visit this place. I try to visit this place as often as I can and spend 2-3 hours everytime i go there. This is the biggest ISKCON temple that I have been to.Although the place is very crowded but the temple management maintains the crowd well . Evening Aaarti is something one should not miss,For foodies , the Veg resturant is a place one should not miss. Awsome vegetetarian food,",1
ISKON is more than just a temple. Its a beautiful place where we can the convergence of old belief of how a temple should be and the new thought of place to make people involve. The temple area is beautiful and quite and the places around are like mini malls. Everyone is engaged in some form or the other. A must place to visit when in Bangalore.,1
Its a nice place to visit with your loved one and family. Total peace of mind.,1
"The place is good. But the parking facility is not up to the mark. For a first time visitor, it is a bit difficult to understand which is the actual way to see the idol. If any aged person is coming, it is advised to ask the temple guys for lift facility, which is available but needs to be notified appropriately.",1
"South India is dotted with temples everywhere, but this is an modern temple on a hill top, quiet within the city. Comfortable parking space, good food options within premises - try ""Higher Taste"", at the back of the temple, within the premises, nice open spaces and good gentry. You will be able to spend 2 hours or more as you may like.. Early Morning visit is the best, 5 to 8 am, I happened to visit on Janamastmi which was a very festive affair. Timings: 4am to 1pm, 4pm to 8pm I have not tried the 3D & 4D movies in its cinema yet .. Visited August 2014",1
"It's been on the must visit list for a while now and continuous to maintain its attractiveness. Apart from all the religious aspects and structural aesthetics, the ability and commitment of ISKCONites in managing a flood of visitors every day is admirable.",1
"One thing about the place is the cleanliness. When other temples have grime, this temple is sparklingly clean. One more thing ISKCON does well is commercialize. They have a multi cuisine food joint in place and rates justify a fine dining facility, more than a temple. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r294588255-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
"Crowded on week ends, otherwise peaceful temple, place to meditate. Gives a person immense pleasure to just be there.",1
"It is a beautifully constructed temple, the area of the temple is so huge. Just loved the culture there of darshan and chanting both... Blissful experience.",1
"I visited Best discipline is maintained in this place. You can go with all Ur family members .. You Wil find many things inside.. Books, food, krishna movie show cartoon, the money you pay for all these goes to akshaya patre (free midday meals) for school kidsthis temple in January 2016, more as someone wanting to eat at their fine-dining restaurant - The Higher Taste. This is a modern iconic site, a must visit site, whether you are a devotee or not. There is parking space available and the visitors/ devotees are taken through the temple through organized queues. There is a low-cost eating joint as well as a fine-dining restaurant. The place is well-managed and is also involved in a lot of charitable work. Their famous charity is providing free cooked lunch to school kids studying in many Government schools under the brand AKSHAYA PATRA. This scheme improves attendance of school among kids from economically backward families. The hot lunch is cooked and delivered to the schools using a fleet of vans and trucks.",1
I think ISKCON temple of Bangalore is the most impressive and prominent temples in Bangalore city. It is a very well maintained temple and you have a Big Hall wherein you can do worship of Lord Krishna and there are beautiful paintings in the temple and you can meditate in the beautiful hall of the temple. Really a place to be visited when you are in Banglore. The place is full of positive vibes and yes you really feel to be here for some more... :),1
I have been a spiritual tourist coming to India for 50 years. Well worth to visit this (or any other) ISKCON center. the food (prasadam) is excellent.,1
"It was amazing, I'm spellbound, no words to describe my feelings and experience...... I just know that I love bhagwan vishnu",1
Most updated. Keep it up. We have also personally visited and could not spend more time. But from the site we could see what we missed.,1
""" Wow ! What a beautiful place "" Iscon temple has a good ambiance. The temple is located on the top of a hill which g...",1
"a place where people can spend time meditating as there is peace and tranquility everywhere. also, the temple is well maintained amd serve wonderful prasadam to devotees",1
"i heard a lot about this temple so I just went to visit the temple. Its nicely built and beautiful. quite clean and well organized. but i didn't really like the temple in other way. they force you to be part of events, force you to buy books, have to go through all the shops to exit from temple. It gives you feel like fully commercialized.",0
As is with all ISKCON temples; this one is very well maintained and quite huge temple. Serene atmosphere,1
Radhe radhe,1
If you believe in GodIt was simply wow.. peaceful temple.. one of the largest ISKCON temples that I have visited.. clean and organised..will go again everytime I visit Bengaluru... search the almighty in your heart rather than come down to this place.God is sold in stickers toys and cds.Commercialization of religion at its worse,1
"a place which is not only well maintained but also well coordinated. It has arrangements for fats darshan, special lifts for senior citizens and kids (infants). as soon as you reach the main hall you will feel the vibration. beautiful place.",1
Nice place for family visit,1
"My first visit to this temple...in fact any of the large ISKCON temples. The construction of the temple on the hill and the layout is absolutely amazing. However it is way too commercialized with the ""prasadam"" area selling more varieties of sweets, samosa and other stuff than any other temple I've ever visited. If you are after a quiet temple to sit and meditate/reflect then this is not your destination.",0
"Poorly organized for tourists. Instead of being a temple it seems to be rather a market selling religious goods, books and food. Important not to carry electronic equipment or cameras.",0
"A must visit temple: Beautiful, clean and attractive. Food stalls are also wonderful. One downside is the length of queues.",1
Very calm and quiet and clean place...,1
"It's a must visit when you are in Bangalore. If possible visit for early morning or late evening and you can get a glimpse of wonderful bhajans and dance by devotees to wake the Lord or while making Lord Krishna sleep. You can get Darshan of Lord venkateshwara and narasimha in addition to radha Krishna (main temple).For those who cannot climb the stairs, there is a facility of lift which reaches the main temple. If you want to shop divine items, after Darshan there are lots of choices. For kids, there is a theatre where they play few interest in movies of Lord Krishna. You will need about 2-3hrs in the premises. Last but not least don't miss out on yummy prasadam.",1
Nice temple to have peaceful mind. Very well maintained. Very clean environment. Facilities are good. Food quality in shops also good.,1
We're not followers of Hare Krishna but appreciated the fervor of those who do follow at this lovely temple.,1
Good Temple in Bangalore,1
Really nice temple,1
"Its a nice temple with peaceful environment. Ample parking space and nice approach road make it easy to visit. After darshan, you have to pass through souvenir shops and eateries. Buy only if you like. As far as eateries are considered, lot of options are available. Avoid visiting on weekend evening particularly during school holidays. At any rate you should plan the visit.",1
A beautiful temple which is known for its calm and cleanly surroundings..really well maintained...Wear clothes that covers till your knees or rent the clothes from there itself (which you can return after the visit). Can be visited by people of all religion.,1
"Must visit...The sheer beauty of the dietys takes you to a different world..Just lose yourself in their mellowing eyes and forget ALL your worries, tensions and pains of this material world for ever. Do take the free prasaadam when returning and chant the Hare Krshna mahamantra with you for ever after...Hari Bol",1
Rama Krishna temple clean nice,1
Real follower of srila prabhupada,1
It is to be seen to be believed the way Gokulashtami also called Sri Krishna Janmashtami is celebrated in ISKCON specially Bengaluru and in Salem as well. Very grand very religious is all that I can tell.,1
"A very serene, peaceful & spiritual place. The moment u enter the temple's complex, there's a security check, no photography is allowed inside the temple. U will start chanting the Hare Krishna mantra before entering the main sanctum to pay respects to the beautiful Krishna, chanting is not compulsary however but u observe total silence and unconsciously u wld have chanted the mantra 108 times! Free prasad is given towards the end of your visit before you exit the temple. Lots of savoury and sweet snacks on sale too. Lots of souvenirs are also on sale. A beautiful temple to visit.",1
It is a nice clean and big temple surrounded by a well maintained garden. The children may find it boring.There is a restaurant and store selling many religious stuff within the temple complex. I liked the prasadam very much.Infact all our group members relished it. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r271250909-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#,1

Spending time spiritually is the need of every working person..had a good darshan of Lord Krishna and radha..and got a chance to enjoy few bhajans...and the items being sold outside are worth watching?,1
feeling good,1
I have visited only once but the experience was nice and good place to relax and to free our mind and to forget the tension form a busy day life,1
Best place to visit. Just few meters distance from metro station. Near Orion mall. One must visit while in Bangalore.,1
We loved to visit every time. Nice Krishna deity's,1
Without a doubt a beautifully kept and managed temple. Good to visit if you are in the vicinity Pros 1. The idols are very beautiful 2. The crowd in very well managed 3. Facilities for storing shoes/cameras etc are well done. Cons 1. Lacks the ambiance of a traditional Hindu temple 2. They won't allow cameras but people take pics with cellphones and the temple sells pics as well. Instead they should allow cameras and charge a fee for the same. 3. I spent a long time getting out of the temple though the various gift shops. Almost felt like ikea Visited August 2014,0
Must Visit,1
"Good tourist place, Hare ram hare ram ram ram hare hare hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare",1
My god I love Lord Krishna's temple because he is my soul god and ISKCON is super place for devotion for all people. I was very glad to see see many avatars of Lord Vishnu in this temple and I often visits this temple and it is good I mean really good,1

One of the must visit places in Bangalore. Rich looks and stylish,1
This is a great temple to visit in Bangalore. Recommend to go with someone local so you understand the customs / process.,1
awesome place to visit. Well maintain by volunteers,1
"one of the landmark of Bangalore the temple was constructed around 20 years back. The temple has 3 temples one dedicated to Lord Prahlada Narasimha, one to Sri Balaji , One to Lord Radha krishna, Sri Krishna Balaram and to Sri Nitai Gauranga. the temple is very well kept and the deity's are very well decorated. If you get a chance one can also see the operation of the Akshaya patra kitchen which feeds 1.4 million children in India and operates mainly during the mornings. They also have the higher taste restaurant where one can have delicious prasadam. A must visit to one who visits bangalore city. Make some time so visit this place and if you request in advance a devotee can take you around . The Akshaya patra is a very noble operation of iskcon Bangalore ande certainly needs our support.",1
"This temple is in Rajajinagar, close to the city center. It is an extremely beautiful and well-maintained temple, located on a hillock and is best visited during the cooler months of the year, either early in the morning or just before sunset for good views. I am not sure if there is a formal dress code notice. But being a place of worship, it is best to be in decent attire. I went there during non-peak hours. It also wasn't during the festive season, so it was not very crowded. Quite a bit of walk is involved as the temple complex is quite huge. The Hare Krishna chanting in the temple is pleasant. Food (like eggless cakes, savouries and sweets) is awesome inside the complex and is sold at very reasonable rates (other than the 'prasadam' which is of course offered free to all devotees). Besides there are quite a few shops selling art work and crafts (like Tanjore paintings, religious idols, incense sticks, sandalwood scented items, souvenirs). The whole experience is soothing and surely worth a visit.",1
I have visited many ISKCON temples and Bengaluru one is the one with most restrictions .. The entire path is designed in a way that you are forced to visit each outlet .. Seemed more like a mall to me .. The only solace was the song sung by the devotees which somewhat reminded me of Vrindvan .. Was with friends so enjoyed the experience ..,0
See The photos you will know how beautiful and peaceful it is there . Must visit place .Because it is not allowed to take photos inside the temple but you will be mesmerised by the artwork,1
"The Temple, though, situated in the heart of Bengaluru City has a large campus. It is easily reachable from all the corners of Bengaluru and is a popular landmark in the City. The steps, though pose a little strain to the elderly people, are comfortable to climb and makes the visit really pleasant. The main temple is located in a very spacious hall, where meditation can be done with peace. The prasadam ( pongal ) provided by the Temple is nutritious. There are several marriage halls in the temple complex. By and large, visiting this Temple makes a great and memorable experience.",1
Superb,1
A must-visit place for spiritually inclined persons. The sanctum sanctum dome is exquisitely painted with pictures of Lord Krishna,1

"Great place to spend some time in spiritual environment. Excellent infrastructure, good food & excellent gift articles. A lot to feel & enjoy the spirituality.",1
Iskon Hare Krishna Temple or commonly known as Hare Krishna Temple is worth a visit place in Bangalore. Anybody can visit this temple and the atmosphere is very calm and quiet. Thousands of people visit this Temple everyday. There is food available here. Gokulastami - Krishna's Birthday is celebrated hre for a week or more. They have music and dance festival here at that time. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r268431918-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#,1
"Place connects with your heart and soul , you can feel positive energy within you and maybe you could find best answers about life, motivate yourself through teachings of LORD KRISHNA..",1
Wonderful modern Krishna temple. I recommend early morning visit to experience delightful Mangal Arti. You can buy spiritual books too. Well connected by public transport.,1
"A wonderful place, and very well maintained by the pujari's. Been there with family, and trust me one such place in Bangalore, where whenever you go, you will feel the positive energy there.",1
"Lord Krishna is being worshiped daily more than 50,000 people from India and foreign devotees. The temple is maintained neatly. They chant , including the daily visitors ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" throughout day. The dedicated Krishna followers are helping the visitors with kind and affection. It is one of the must visiting place at Bangalore. Do not miss to see and get Krishna's blessings.",0
"Excellent,had a marvellous experience..",1
Heavenly experience during aarti. Jai Shree Krishna !!,1
"Its a very big temple of Radha Krishna maintained by ISKCON. Its very near to Yeswantpur Railway station. I feel very calm, peace and full of energy after going and having darshan of Radha Krishna.",1
"Very well built, neatly maintained,,,traditional poojas,,,it is amazing suprabhatha darshan of Lord Narasimha,, balaji,, radhakrishna in the morning 7 am daily...all types of food as prasadams are sold.free prasadam also available..enjoy krishnaleela movies in good theater..lot of purchase,,organic items ,,krishna dolls are pretty. Akshaya paatra scheme,, free lunch for school children distribution done every day... Accomidation,, marriage hall also available... Dont miss if you are visiting Bangalore",1
Nice architecture though it is a modern day temple. Lots of shopping after the darshan on the way out.,1
"Well maintained temple with cleanliness, Good place to enjoy with friends and family. Can Taste diverse zoner of food.",1
"Divine Sacred place, rather than pointing it as temple i would say those who seek blessings of their atma, can get the vibration here",1
It is a beautiful place to worship and know more about importance of our life. After visiting there I understood the true importance of life and how to utilize it efficiently by serving to Lord.,1
As the name says .. Krishna consciousness is made by the way you chant and climb the steps to work ship the deity. Get missed,1
Its a grand temple on top of hill hence be ready for a decent walk.Old people who want to walk less can use elevator directly to main temple entrance. Enough parking. Only -ve is highly commercialized,1
Iskon temple visit is good but inside we won't feel like temple and complete artificial feeling and full commercial,0
"quite a spiritual place; enjoyed the walking through the temple and the blessings received. Enjoyed the experience immensely, thumbs up for a view on different cultural / religious site.",1
"Love the atmosphere here, very healthy to climb till top :) the ambience near the fountain is great, good parking facility too",1
You can literally see how rich these people are. How much money they are spending here. Anyhow a nice place to visit,1
"ISKON is always very peaceful to visit. Goo time is to vista's around noon as the at 12.30pm you get to see the aarti also. The crowd is very well managed by volunteers wich makes the visit tension free. Elderly can go up in wheelchair using a lift. Inside the mandir you get laddos as snacks like samosa, kachoree, gila jamun, bhajee etc followed by piping hot prasad at the exit. Outside you have a cafe and find dining- Higher Taste. Food at both the place is good. On the whole a great experience.",1
Good temple to visit if you have the time. Large crowds so get there early in the day. Was great to see the services live. Beautiful,1
if u want some tranquility please visit this place to rid urself of all ur sins done in the present life...if u r in bangalroe and u dont vsiit this place u r definitely missing something big Visited September 2014,1
"I found this place a bit commercial, missing the 'divine' element. If you look at it from the perspective of a tourist attraction, then it is nice, but from the perspective of a temple, I was disappointed. Good architecture, and the queues are well organised - if you have to stand in one - you can skip it if you are visiting on a weekday afternoon. I went there all the way from the South of Bangalore - not something I would deem worth - however, it is definitely worth a visit if you are nearby.",0
"I visited the ISKON temple after few months with family. The centrum is as attractive and divine as always been. You feel inner peace here. It?s one of the most well managed temples, I have even seen and experienced. A very clean, organized and perfect place to spend some good quality time with oneself. What I did not like is a bit overdose of commercialization, starting from centrum itself, where books are sold and then a pass through eatery and outlets selling other stuff and everyone mandatorily needs to go through these. There should be an exit, which should allow devotees an option to move out without going through the market. Also, the book shop in the main temple should be relocated to one of the lower floors. Early morning or early after noon?s are good time to avoid rush. Temple also has facility for speedy darshan by buying a puja coupon. I normally take this, and it provide place to seat in from of deities and do puja. Good car parking facilities. It also has a restaurant which serves pure veg food. Also has rooms to stay but I never stayed there.",1
This is one of the best ISKONs I have visited across India. I have been to 4 other ISKONs and this one has been the best so far. Spread over huge area this is definitely a delight for the soul. I visited their during evening and the the time when darshan opened was a beautiful view with devotees and other people dancing to the tunes in full enjoyment. An absolute delight.,1
"I love the chant of ""Hare krishna"" going on in the backgound. I would recommend not to go there on a weekend or a festival because then there is too much crowd. Once you finish your 108 chanting on the way to the main shrine then you can go to the amphitheatre to know more about Krishna or head to the cafeteria and eat some really good satvik food. Cost for 2 is about 500. you can also purchase prayer beads or books or souvenirs to give people from their in house store. Also on sale is the prasad(coconut barfi being my personal favorite).",1
"Business only, beware of blind faith",0
It was indeed a great experience visiting this magnificent temple. Definitely a must visit for all temple lovers.,1
Its a good spiritual and social helping,1
Recently we went to this temple after a heavy breakfast.The temple is located at heighe but vehicles can go till top.Good parking arrangements and temple is modren well maintained.Good queue ystems and good restaurent at reasonable price.There is also well maintained shops and you can do lot of shopping.Preying area is good and overall worth visiting on a bangalore trip.,1
"Good temple, one should go to this temple at least once in a week. you have find many a thing inside, for parking there is no problem.",1
The best Temple of Bangalore,1
The place is really nice and quite well run. Everything seems to have been take care of. Like a certain nearby temple...,1
Very nice and well maintained place.,1
A temple so huge and having such kind of population visiting everyday would leave any management in chaos. But looking at the professionalism of the the management here was a spectacular experience.,1
"Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare It's very Awesome, Beauti...",1
"Nice place to visit, should visit in evening so that there won't be any Rush. It's well maintained specially the architecture",0
If you are looking for a peaceful location Iskon is the right choice. A little far from city center but worth visiting. One can also experience its prasadam which is loaded with pure ghee.,0
ISKCON Temple of Bangalore is well maintained but more of commercial than devotional. Consider paying a visit once if you are in Bangalore. It would take around an hour for the complete walk through around the temple facility.,1
Nothing more to say - it's a breathtakingly beautiful building with a peaceful message. Lovely people. Good parking and great organisation of queues,1
"This place is very calm and peaceful place. Well planned temple. Please visit temple evening time, it will very nice.",1
Iskcon banglore must visit..u fil the peace of mind whem u enter of main temple..u require atlist 2 hrs for seen this temple.. Ye nai dekha to kuch nahi dekha...must go..and must visot in evening time.,1
Devote or not. This place is a must visit for its beautiful architecture. The food / Prasad offered is very well made and the taste is not compromise. This place is a Hindu worship place for Lord Krishna.,1
Today I am going to iskon temple. Very nice and beautiful temple.,1
"I personally felt that this was way too much commercialized, right from the books to over priced eateries, shops it was more like a crowded hangout place",0
Gud architecture of temple but unnecessary long walk! from chappal stand you hav to walk 15 mins to reach upto the main temple...so many stairs and zigzag rows...and paid chappal stand service!...,0
Good place to visit. Clean and calm. Also places available to buy souvenirs and food items also. A place to visit if in bangalore.,1
"Well the title says it all. This place is well barricaded, well maintained by the sevaks/security personnel who in turn guide the devotees to the main temple. Though it feels a little frustrating as you have to walk a long way up to the main temple but as you reach the main temple mere darshan of holy god takes away all your tiredness. I did not liked the way ISKCON is marketing Krishna but it's my personal view. This place is good for people who are able to walk properly and balance themselves as there's a lot of push and pull due to huge crowd gatherings. The free prasadam counter is at a very narrow corner. The temple trustee may rethink of moving it. I have visited the temple more than couple of times but will advise people/bhakts to avoid Sunday's or any special holy day since its overcrowded and it leads to fracas between the temple securities/sevaks who maintain the huge queues and even at the pvt. car entrance. For aged people although they have offered wheel chair service but it will be good if they provide sevaks to push the wheel chairs as well. Overall the experience of visiting this place is heavenly as you enter the garbha gruha or main temple you forget all your complaints,that's the beauty of god. So just a word of advice try avoid this place on overcrowded days and don't take aged people along with you who can't walk properly. The views are entirely personal not meant to be hurt anyone. Jai shree krishna!!!",1
"We visited the temple today evening and for me it is a second visit after 13 years . A sight of Hare Krishna at top of the temple is just like a feel at heaven. Well maintained and organized temple. Post darshan, there is plenty to eat &shop around -prasadan stall offers plenty of snacks which are to be paid , besides their traditional awesome prasadam. Today being a Sunday heavy crowded but nevertheless well organized -excellent parking facility. Worthy weekly visit for those close by and must visit for tourist to experience the blissful feel. Hare Krishna",1
The temple is well maintained and has many photo views from entrance to the temple there are many views which are beautiful and can be captured. In the temple the painting on the ceiling is eye capturing. And when you look at the sculpture of lord Krishna and Radha it is also very beautiful. The slowing moving to exit just before it is an canteen where many varieties of food is available at reasonable rate. Had a nice time by listening to mantras at the temple and sitting peacefully.,1
Very well organised place,1
"The ISKCON temple in Bangalore is a large one, with a mix of modern and old architecture. The temple is as clean as possible, despite a quite large daily footfall. The tranquil environment can be felt by spending some time at the main prayer hall.",1
Nice well maintained and clean temple. The temple was constructed in white marble and was a quiet place to meditate,1
"Great location, serene location. A temple to visit and leave all our anxiety n troubles. The Idols are good, you can have your lunch at temple, or buy hygienically prepared food.",1
A must visit place in Bangalore. Very well kept. Try to be present during one of the aaratis. Has a very good vegetarian restaurant too.,1
I visited the temple with my family. Temple was well maintained with good amount of space for worship. We can go near the temple in car (for elderly people). With lots of shops it seems bit commercialised. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r302726462-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#,1
"A friend took us to ISKCON for the 7 AM darshana. I am not Hindu, but it was an enlightening and enlivening spiritual experience. Thanks to our friend who gave us commentaries every now and then about what is happening during the ceremony. The energy all around (with all the dancing and singing) was contagious. The temple is very clean and well maintained despite the huge number of people visiting the place. It was my first time to visit a Hindu temple, and it made a good impression. After the ceremony, we had light breakfast treats from one of their cafeteria stalls. On our way out, we got to chug down some ""food from the gods"" that are served on dried bowl-shaped leaves. It warmed our tummies and our hearts. :)",1
"Nice place to eat out, you've so many options to choose from. The discipline, cleanliness and the ambiance is very well maintained here. Very cleanly atmosphere friendly treatment good food well organised.In short this is a beautiful temple.",1
Top class infrastructure..One of the properly planned temples in the ISKCON chain. It is huge & stunning from inside.,1
Nice place hare Krishna temple.. Beautiful bhajans and keertans ... Beauty of lord radha Krishna is super.. Lovely place,1
A good place to hangout in the evening with family . We were a group of six and had a pleasant evening .If you are an atheist better avoid,1
"I have visited the ISKCON temple in Mumbai. This one in Bangalore was still bigger and majestic than Mumbai. Also the temple was situated over a hillock adding dimensions. The are lot of food stalls in the temple.. Buy them if you are really hungry a lot. Because the free prasadam, which is the most tastiest is served hot only at the end of the temple. So keep some space in your tummy for having that free prasadam at the end.",1
"Good Temple, The temple environment feeling like Vaikunta, every person must visit this temple in his life.",1
VisiVisit to this place gives u serene satisfaction and pleasure.. Appreciate the way the entire campus is maintained.. Should be lucky to visit ISKONt in the evening - and stay back for the aarti Try and avoid the special pooja days when the place can be very crowded,1
Don't miss this Gaudiya Vaishnava Temple located at rajajinager in the north of Bangalore. It is one of the largest Iskcon Temples in the world and was well worth a visit - very impressive. The main shrine is very beautiful and the icons are magnificant. It is open to all religions and none and has a fastrack area for foreigners which was great for those of us on a tight sightseeing schedule.One of the nicest temples I have visited in all of India and well worth a visit - dont miss it if you are in the area.,1
"It was a beautiful temple, very organised. However, I cannot understand why there is the concept of pay for quicker access? If we don't pay the ""special"" package price or so, we have to line up and walk a slightly longer and intertwining path compared to the ""express pass"". Are you trying to take money from people who just want to pray? Places of worship are not meant to make money off people. Maintenance? Take it from donations or put a standard entrance fee.",0
Just went to take a lookout unless you are of that religion its not really worth a visit in my opinion.,0
"Wonderful clean neat temple in the heart of busy Bangalore. Not that friendly for senior citizens, since my father ha...",0
"ISKCON has two temples in Bangalore, of which the one at Hare Krishna Hill in Rajajinagar is the more popular one. A large complex built in the Dravidian style, this temple sees a heavy rush from devotees particularly on weekends and during festivals, hence, one needs to plan to spend time before going. The temple has beautiful fountains and carvings. The idols are all well-crafted (refer to the pics of the same on their website). There are also food stalls, book stores and stalls for devotional items, as common with other ISKCON temples. The prasadam is extremely tasty and hygienic. The temple is kept clean by the volunteers. One needs to deposit one's bag etc. before entering. Parking can be an issue during peak hours, but considering the place is a short walk from the nearby metro station and Yeshwantpur bus and railway stations, getting here is not much of an issue.",1
"Just like all the ISKCON temples, this one is also a classic structure, well built well laid out Quite spaceous the pooja/aarti is a must go. try the evening one. if you are if you lucky enough, you can get a chance to join along with the temple clan singing the bhajans/praises of lord krishna. Overall its a good experience for exploring the cultural side of the city. Try the food here, its different than usual but feels organic.",1
Beautiful and Well Maintained... Parking is well organized... But didn't feel like a Temple... It was more like a Mall !!! The chanting in the speakers were a bit loud !!! N quite a costly God!!!,0
The ISKON temple at Rajaji Nagar is a must go for any tourist to Bangalore. For the believers there is the serene atmosphere in the huge sanctorum with wonderful idols of Sri Krishna Radha and other dieties. One can feel the divinity in the atmosphere there. Then there is the wonderful shopping complex in the lower levels of the temple with wonderful decorative products produced by the Society. The idols of Krishna are worth more than their monetary value. There is also a wonderful restaurant with multi cuisine menu worth tasting. Whats more the place is a haven for foodies also. One can say that there is a wonderful fusion of divinity with modernity.,1
"Wonderful place, all time favourite!",1
"A well organized hindu religious temple. I along with my family members visited the temple in the donation Rs.300/-. A prasadam with discount coupon was given which is adjusted in the purchase of books. I bought one Krishna book. The free prasadam given there is very nice. The stall for purchase of various materials is grand. I feel somewhat costlier. But, the materials are of good quality.",1
"This is one of the places you simply can't miss in Bangalore! Please remember that, you are not allowed to enter the complex with camera. (But you can have it stored).",1
"Frankly I was having my reservations about Iskcon. Finally decided to visit the temple with Family. To my surprise, it was an excellent temple. It is a bit commercialized but nobody force you to buy. So it purely depends on you. The statues looks divine and so does the surrounding. Prasadam was very tasty as well :). If you are in Bangalore, then take out some time for this temple and experience the calmness and peace in divine power.",1

Must Visit in Bangalore. One of the biggest and most beautiful temples. Feels like the stairs rise up to the lord's abode. Chant the lord's sloka 108 times in the temple. Various avatars of Lord Krishna come alive int he temple. Pure veg food and meals served at cafeteria. Cakes etc also available for occasions (pure veg). No long queues. Very peaceful and serene.,1
Good place to visit and have nice yummy food. Try to avoid weekend as it crowded. If you come during the aarti time in the evening is the best time to see the temple and the surrounding.,1
"ISKCON temple is a must visit especially if you have not visited it in any other city. It is clean, serene. There is plenty of food , both free (Prasad) and paid one.

"The ISKCON ( International society of Krishna Consciousness) temple is Bangalore is a beautiful spiritual place which should be on the 'must see' list of any visitor to Bangalore, irrespective of their religious beliefs. The magnificent and opulent temple and the grounds are kept spotlessly clean 24/7 by an army of devotees. The jaw dropping main prayer room is the centerpiece of an architecturally grand structure , which is a fusion of modern glass pyramid with traditional Hindu Gopuram. While the temple is always crowded and especially so during Festivals, crowd control through proper channels makes the visit a pleasure. The temple also features a beautiful marriage hall with facilities for feeding lavish meals to hundreds of guests . As part of the temple, a commercial kitchen feeds free lunch to thousands of poor school children throughout Bangalore. The temple also features a very upscale vegetarian restaurant 'Higher Taste' which is available for lunch and dinner and is definitely worth a visit.",1
A must see temple..,1
"Good temple i like the temple, Nicely maintained, cleanliness and queue for footwear and bags, etc. Good place to buy things for worship like books, and other articles, prices are reasonable. Food served is good but limited space to sit and eat. Parshad is also nice.",1
"Really neat & clean temple, I must stay this will be biggest temple in India. It took us 40min to take Darshan and then come out to food and book stall area, food were there very cheap and verities were more than 30 items. Everything is well managed over there from entrance to exit, like parking, lane, counters etc. Temple staff also very helpful they were guiding in well manner to move ahead. Also they have free food (Prasadam) at last exit point. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r289092871-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1

buy tickets and then you don't stand in a queue. bring socks because you must take off your shoes. Remember the place you leave your shoes,0
The place is located at an excellent location. Very well maintained and good discipline for traffic movement. The restaurants inside are excellent. You can have buffet as well as alacarte. The food is excellent and staff is courteous. Even on a regular days when not going to temple its orth going for food to any of its resrtaurant. Must go once.,1

Very good clean temple i think all over India. In cleanness first is somnath and than it.,1
Very clean place. Commercial place,1

"Because it was free time, I tried to come to this temple of the top ranking. Enshrined Krishna is like a temple, but is referred to as a temple surprised a little to the mismatch modern building ish building. Go barefoot entrust the shoes and luggage. Or terrible human thing is when you are busy, and go through the usual route to proceed in the fence like a Disneyland of waiting are determined to Gatchigachi. Because barefoot such, is painful feeling towards the squeamish. Although the building is modern, the contents are firmly impressive figure that is a choice and everyone eagerly in the temple. Candy past the large main hall? Of behavior and, pattern during the daytime, which is also eat free lunch (except complete local food). Followed by a stall that sells Krishna goods and souvenirs fairly, that they finally be to go out, I think also the kana became a good temple in the sturdiness of this commercial spirit. Or because the worshipers visit from all over India, you of salesgirl in the corner to sell a book about Krishna is divided into various parts of the language monk? And this has been arranged, I think that seems to India. Interest I think that is not interesting that there is no, but if you want to take a look at the Indian temples, are also to people and I think that's visited a convenient location with confidence because a lot maintenance. However seems foreign tourists people, during my stay I did not see any.",0
It is a must visit. I had never been to ISKON temple before and this was my first time. I was really amazed by the colorful ceiling and how well lit the temple was inside with grand chandeliers. The statues of radha krishna were really beautiful!! I did not feel like leaving the place. The temple has lot of security so you would need to deposit everything before you enter. I visited the place many years ago so i don't know how it is now. Planning to visit soon. Visited October 2013,1
In early morning we visited this radha Krishna temple really very nice atmosphere with very neat & clean temple And we entered to the temple and spent near about hours there .it is really nice temple.,1
"Temple is good, clean and staffs are very kind and polite.",1
"Temple rather unusual both outside and inside, but we were not particularly impressed by it. At the entrance of the Indians quietly passed, and foreign tourists stopped and asked to make a donation of 300 rupees, but you can ignore it. Just at the entrance it is necessary to leave the shoes, if you have large bags or backpacks and cameras (phones can carry). So all the best to leave valuables at home.",0
The architecture here is excellent and the way the temple is built is amazing should visit it. Should go and enjoy the place its amazing,1
It's just amazing place because of cleanliness is Godliness,1
"Far different from the temples and temple complexes that we have seen in our life. But even though a modern ambiance and architecture, the divinity is not lost a bit with 'Hare Rama, Hare Krishna' reverberating in ones ears and soul once we are in.",1
the architecture and temple ambience will definitely mesmerize you. it will be like a different world itself.. but after you come down stairs you feel like what in the name of god this is.. it is like a shopping mall down stairs..,0
The temple is good in architecture . There is always rush in this temple . The temple is clean . A must visit if you are in Bangalore.No photography allowed inside the temple so keep your cameras in the car or you have to submit it at the start of the temple.,0

"Excellent place to visit the details inside and out are incredible. It is worth noting that legs need to be covered, and you will need to be barefoot so dont turn up in shorts or you will need to rent a cloth to cover your legs. Very welcoming place to visit.",1
"No doubt that temple is excellent, food and prasad is awesome but I stopped going because ppls there force you to buy the things or for donation. These things should be from inside not by others. If you can avoid it, you must visit. Their restaurant is also very good. MUST try.",0
"The temple is very well maintained and beautiful. Personally i found a little of spirituality , may be because its a lot different from cultures and traditions in a typical Kerala temple. But its a must visit at least once to feel the experience.",1
Well made temple. Recommend to go in the evening time where you can see the beauty of temple in lights and also there would be some kind of dance inside the temple for the bhajan. Its very nice?,1
Very well maintained. Good place to sit and meditate.,1
Lord Krishna is a Devine god we need to pray here.,1
This is very nice place to visit. The management to place your valuable things as well as your shoes is very good. This facility is paid but at very cheap price. Shorts are not allowed in this temple but they provides traditional cloth for entering in temple. The Special DARSHAN is paid. There are many things are available to buy in the premises of the temple.,1
"Well as usual part of ISKCON society.. located near ORION mall ..quite good place to visit.. you have to submit ur SLIPPERS,SHOES THR ...when u reach just near the temple, for each step you have to say..""HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE"" and move one step forward.. rest is aarti tym and some sculptures and art to see.. water fountain at dawn... & last is PRASAD OF KHICHDI ..which is tasty can take two haha..!!",1
Nice place. it's neat and clean.,1
Beautiful and Well Maintained... Parking is well organized... But didn't feel like a Temple... It was more like a Mall !!! The chanting in the speakers were a bit loud !!! N quite a costly God!!!,0
"this is amazing place of god,,,I really believe in Radha Krishna... Radhe Radhe,,,",1
"Iskcon temple is a famous Radha-krishna temple in india . Situated in Rajajinagar, Bangalore .Its one of the main attractions in Bangalore . The temple and surroundings are maintained well with gardens. The cleanliness is the most important thing that we can experience there . There is a large space for keeping the chappals & baggages . Nearest Railway station- Yeshwanthpur Nearest Metro station - Mahalaxmi",1
Devotional and peaceful.... Also a good business platform in the Name of krishna,1
Gives a peaceful relaxation period when u are here. More then a temple it's like a Complex .. Has been maintained very well.... Serves good food also,1
Not a nice place to visit. You will be insisted on to buy a special pass that none of the locals will buy. Then it is a one way maze of processions around various parts of the temple. With lots of opportunities to spend money on goods and knick knacks. Avoid if you're not in the mood for chaos and pushy people.,0
This place is very good and the temple of Radha Krishna is one thing you will want to visit in Bangalore. It is a great place to start your weekend and enjoy roaming around.,1
Very much peaceful.. Center for eternal Bliss and knowledge.. Do join YOGA FOR HAPPINESS program...,1
Its a very good temple...I always like so much to visit Iskcon temple...there Bhajans are very good...if people will sit to here those Bhajans than they never think of leaving that place?,1
Nice place to go if you've got an hour to kill.,1
This plac is a must visit. The main arti in d evening shall not be missed. Loved their hospitality. Place is very peaceful and calm.,1
"The ISKCON temple in Rajaji Nagar area is a landmark dating back several decades. Although a prominent landmark, on top of a hillock, it is now overshadowed by high-rise apartments and malls in the vicinity. The facility is well maintained and welcomes visitors and tourists alike. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r298657260-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
Lovely place ... Must see for anyone visiting Bangalore !!!,1
Its a really superb construction and a highly spiritual place,1
"Everyday Morning 4:15 am to 5:00 am Monday to Friday: 7:15 am to 1:00 pm 4:15 pm to 8:15 pm Saturdays, Sundays & Public Holidays: 7:15 am to 8:15 pm",1
"Nice, pleasant and devotional place. Can be visited by couples, family or along with friends. You can visit this place any time of the day, month or year.",0
"The serenity and beauty of this place has been marred by its commercialization....but yes, it can be visited once if you appreciate architecture. Avoid visiting on special occasions because the crowd gets too suffocating.",1
Its a must to visit. One of the places that should be on your list when you head to Bangalore. Deities are so pretty and it is also peaceful.,1
This place is a perfect Example of whatever is wrong with religious places in India. Thousand of people are swarming over a place where they are treated as cattles (not surprisingly most of them deserved to be treated like that as in spite of strict instructions to keep moving they keep on standing at one place and gawking over the idols). But it does not give any right to the management to force us through entire shopping area without giving any choice. It's like hou are being punished to come to this place or not believing people who warned you against this behaviour. I know people managing these places have no more interest in deity than ensuring their heavy pockets but still be they can afford to be courteous enough to make it look little more like a temple than a shopping complex.,0
"If you can, visit with a Hindu friend; it gives a deeper more meaningful understanding of the shrines purpose.",1
Nice infrastructure and decent place for worship,1
Feels like visiting a luxurious Hotel Not a Temple,0
Mostly about lord Krishna. Temple is modern and awesome. take the free prasada than the paid one. It tastes well.,1
Felt blessed Very beautiful and calm place Want to go again and again,1
"The visitors of this otherwise busy township, may find some solace in the feet of Lord Krishna. The temple is very neat & clean and is very humbly offering the meals to the school children The temple is being managed by Akshayapatra Society. This society is having the temple in Vrindavan also.",1
"Hare Krishna temple , a good tourist spot",1
A religious place shud not have any review Yet if u r going for tourism purpose...the temple is incredible in that case.,1
I personally really didn't like my visit to the temple. They expect everyone to travel the entire display and sales area setup promoting their stuff. Please let our belief on Krishna or almighty away from your business,0
"Must see for all travellers.. Awesome darshan of the Lord..Very well organized and a great place for Krishna devotees.. Ample car parking, lots of stalls..",1
Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.. This is the chants that one hears after entering the temple. a well managed temple on a hillock in bangalore.,1
"Very Nice Religious place There are many tourist and religious places in and around Bangalore. It is one of tourist attractions places of Bangalore. Me and my family are visited this place. very Beautiful Temple and Nice Place, very clean and well maintained. must visit this temple. Memorable Experience. Awesome....",0
It is known worldwide of Hindu religion. The place is divine with a firm belief of Krishna and Radha. The sounds of singing can be heard in praise by the devotees to Krishna and Radha. The pure devotion is sung with a profound belief to Krishna and Radha.,1
"This temple, when built was one of the trendsetters of modern bangalore. Situated on a hill and very well maintained, it is a must visit place in bangalore.",1
"This is the most beautiful temple of Shri Radha Krishan. The temple has been built very nicely and it is very clean. They will provide to each visitor their KHICHADI as a Prasad, they serve it very hot and it teats very nice.",1
Please be careful of the dress code. Shorts are not allowed. You can get dhoti on rent which can be wore on top of shorts. Similar to any other ISKCON temple in India. I liked ISKCON MAYAPUR(west Bengal) or the one in Delhi more.Still good place to visit.,0
ISKCON temple is the best place in Bangalore so far I had gone.I didn't feel like coming back. There is lots of stuff like Krishna idols to shop Bhagavad Geeta for separate languages and eateries too. Very well maintained and worth seeing this place,1
Visited this Temple thinking it was just a wee walk around looking at the lovely architecture. How wrong was I! After being guided though two smaller temples we climbed the stairs up to the main temple where we took part in a Krishna service Which was very spiritual although to be hit for a donation at the end did bring us back to earth.,1
good temple,1
This Iskcon temple is one better than other Iskcon's. I mustn't compare a temple but the building is so. Situated on a mini hill covering all of it. Quite big enough to spend good 2 hours here. Radhe Krishna temple in the mid of it and other than it there is a shopping place in between your darshan walk where you can buy all hand made products paintings crafts etc. Sweets are also sold here. The place is free from noise and should you wish to meditate for a while it is a nice place for it. Mahalakshmi metro station is very close by . Must visit.,1
"Visited with friends working together, heard a lot about it so wanted to visit once after seeing it, we were totally amazed with beauty of this temple so pure and soothing. You should visit once to know the creativity.",1
Peace of mind..good ambiance..lovely food..good people,1
Very clean and huge temple of Radhe Krushna in Bengaluru,1
"Iskcon temples are there in most part of India. Having been to most of the Iskcon temples in India, bangalore one's is with a big space and very well maintained. Very peaceful and organised.",1
"This was my 2nd visit to the temple.. last time it took us 45mins to rush through the whole thing.. this time I took over an hour.. I went with my friend and spent some peaceful time there. ample parking space. there was a hotel which is maintained by ISKCON.. u need to have membership to stay in it..we entered the temple after depositing our shoes. photography isn't allowed inside the temple.. although u can take as many once you are out..to get inside u need to follow a line.. first u need to chant aloud ""hare hare Krishna Krishna, Krishna Krishna hare hare"" 108 times.. for that you are given a leaflet in which the following words are written in all the Indian languages and also English. next u need to stand on a tile and move on chanting once per tile.. so there are 108 tiles before you enter.. this is the only ""rate limiting"" area if you are in a hurry.. so if you are in a hurry, your ""hare"" starts sounding like ""hurry""..:Pnext we entered the huge temple.. it's brilliant inside.. the frescoes on the ceiling are breath taking.. there's an area inside the temple where you are allowed to sit for as long as you want.. we reached around 4:30 and waited till 6:30 for the ""arati"".. don't miss the arati.. it's beautiful..:)next we got out.. there's only one way to get out from inside the temple.. it's necessary to go through the devotional market selling devotional art and merchandise.. as you go out you are given ""Prasad"". the temple looks beautiful at night..",1
"Very well managed, organised and maintained. A divine place to visit. In spite of large crowd, the temple is well managed. Must visit if you are in Bangalore.",1
"Peace and cool atmosphere, Thanks to Iskcon international society for maintaining clean and green all around the temple, A must place to visit in Bangalore",1
God Resides Here,1
"Like other ISKON temples this also is very large and majestic. One part I did not like is that it overlooks a block of flats. Being placed on a hill, the climb is bit tough. Overall a good place to spend an afternoon.",1
"This temple is beautiful. The only issue is with the stalls selling books and merchandise. The moment you exit the sanctum sanctorum, you are assailed by those stalls. It is also a safety risk in my view as it makes the exit very crowded and leads to a lot of pushing and shoving. Moreover , there are 2 dedicated floors for shopping and a full fleged food court. Hence it would be better if they dismantled the stalls near the immediate exit of the mail temple.",1
"ISCON Temple and prescints are pristine, calm and good enough for tourists who want to meditate; also someone who believe in Hare Ram and Hare Krishna concept. One more huge ISCON Temple about to come up soon in Bangalore. WHY NOT ""ART OF LIVING""; an equivally good place for such outings; but both are worth visiting places in Bangalore.",1
There I didn't even find any peace... It's more about commercial.... You know isckon places first in India's richest earnings.... This isckon belongs to some foreigner.... Not even Indian... If you wanna see some place then visit this place... But don't come here for peace and godliness...,0
"I really had a very bad experience on 13th Dec 2016 when visited along with my family.... A staff named BISWAJEET at Prasadam stall was proudly passes vulgar comments for each and every female passing by in Bengali. When I questioned him regarding his act he started abusing me instead. When I went to complain against this guy, I was routed to a feedback machine.... I shared my experience at the ISKCON, BANGALORE CAMPUS. Not very such if the management has taken any action against BISWAJEET....",0
"You can feel the peace as soon as you enter into the temple, its a good place for presence of mind. but iskcon is a commercial place with lots of shops.",1
Pretty nice temple to visit and to have some divine moments.,1
"Marvelous architecture, well organized and structured spot administrated by ISKON Group. Feel the difference when visiting the temple. no more words to say.",1
I was wearing shorts when I visited the temple but everything was prepared for such visitors. I rented a cloths to put over my shorts and I was ready to participate in the tour. There were no others visiting the site at the same time so everything was smooth. Monks are all friendly describing what we are supposed to do and painting on the ceiling and the statues were beautiful. It was an interesting experience for me.,1
Wery nice place to pray for all,0
Nice to place to visit for peaceful environment.Need to be present during the pooja time. Timing is from 4.15pm to 8.20 pm,1
Beautiful. Must visit.,1
Get peace,1

"I have been more than 100 times at ISKCON Bangalore. Please see attached photos taken during different occasions. --Best time to visit and the programs: Best time to be at temple is on weekends for Shayanarati / Pallaki utsav programs which starts by 8pm and ends by 8:45 pm. It?s a highly blissful experience. I feel completely energized and recharged each time I attend these functions! Darshanarati at 7:15 am to 8am is also one of the exiting program. --What to do in temple: -Temple consists of 2 restaurants, 1 food counter and a free food counter also. Higher Taste restaurant is one among it. Dinner Buffet cost Rs. 380+ and is delicious. . All items are cooked hygienically, without onion ,garlic(which are considered as food ingredients in the of mode of Tamasic in nature, which agitate human mind), and are offered to Lord Krishna ,hence Prasadam(Remnants of food offered to Lord). Worth trying and value for your money.. -It is important to meet and talk with temple devotes who appears in Saffron or White dress whenever you are at temple, in order to understand the philosophy behind this huge philosophical movement, and go through or buy books from book selling counter. Most of the devotes are well educated ,even IIM, IIT graduates , and are dedicated full time for temple services and are well trained on Vedic knowledge. You can have free consultation at Philosophical desk available at day time to discuss with experts on different topics. -Participate in evening \ morning programs at main temple hall, 8pm or 7:15 am -Visit on any special days or festival days. Facilities: -Shopping counters -Food/prasadam available for purchase -Restaurants -Toilet facilities -Stairs / lift & Wheelchair access -Free philosophical consultation -Book selling counter\Library -Passes for personality enrichment programs -Accommodation ISKCON have 100s of temple at different cities around the world. ISKCON Bangalore is a must visit place in life time.",1
Good place .. Nice Temple ..Temple with with amusements and lord darshan.. spend time in peace ..buy handicrafts,1
"Whenever I go to Bengaluru, I tried my best to go there. I feel peace of soul & peace of mind there. To get Prasadam is best.",0
We spent an afternoon walking through the temple and just soaking it all in. Everyone was very welcoming and inclusive disputed the fact that we were clearly there to see the temple as tourists. It was an amazing experience in a very unique place.,1
Excellent Shri Krishna Temple. I place must visit if you are staying in Bangalore. Very beautiful built and decorated.,1
Jay Ram,1
Very big temple. Temple area is clean and well maintained Long queues are there for darshan Prasad and eatables are offered at end of darshan,1
"The idols in the temple are beautifully decorated, and its a must-do-once place in bangalore, you can learn and pick up a lot of books on Krsna, and Gita, etc.",0
Best place,1
"I often visit this temple, as most of my family who stays in hometown and comes to Bangalore for the first time. this would be the main attraction for them. I have to take them. The place is neat and clean. Well maintained by the staff and volunteers. The shoe stand was weel planned. the way to reach the main temple will take more than 15-20 mins. If you are visiting the temple on weekends and holidays, the queue will be more. But the main hall in the temple feels so artificial. Ideally lot of people will get the intense feeling of temple atmosphere. other than that the temple is a nice place. The stalls in the exit way sells few of the handcrafted article and cloths. paintings and home decorative items. You can taste some yummy food stuff prepared in the ISCKON kitchen(it is paid) and at the end, you will get a free prasada in the exit point. It would take about one hour to complete this.",1
Truly beautiful and magnificent!!!,1
Hare Krishna Hare Rama,1
A famous beautiful temple in Bangalore. The place looks more commercial than a temple.,1
This place turning as a commercial hub rather than concentrating with spirituality. But a good place to visit.,1
Everything is nice except for the fact they try to make money out of everything. There are shops inside the temple wh...,1
"We went there two days before on Navratri ashtami. Not aware of its height and so much zig zag lines even for shoes . And that's for that morning when there was not a single person to visit.no rush no people. There can be short cut way to enter the temple when there is no one , like in airports when there is rush on a particular day they stretch the lines in a zigzag long way .but when there is no rush they cut short. We are senior citizens and heart patients but not the security told us ,not any sign of lift there.we were so much exhausted in climbing three floors height long long paths .after reaching so much height we asked some one there about any other way to go down then he told yes there is a lift there. We were very much surprised and felt bad of their carelessness for not thinking of devotees. These stairs and long paths should be used only on festivals. I request the management to take care of these comforts to public. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r320985441-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",0
Beautiful and awesome place Hare KRISHNA!!,1
I have visited this place for two times. it's calm-quite-devotional and must visited place in Bangalore. Holly Krishna will engraved your heart and there is nice food stalls within iskcon temple.,1
best place for worship,1
"Its always been a wonderful experience being at Iskcon temple. You get ample positive energy when you are Krishna Conscious, as the teachings by Lord Krishna is universal and applicable in your daily life. And in today's dynamic world, we need a strong thought process and for that we need a good foundation.",1
Nice Place,1
"The place is grossly over hyped - from both tourist and spirituality point of view. If you have limited time in Bangalore than better not to prioritize it. As it is, Bangalore traffic takes up a lot of travel time and then the temple security and formality have to be complied with. Even when not crowded, the compulsion to repeat the mantra at every step before entering the darshan hall creates slow moving queues without adding any spiritual value. (Can any enforced experience ever be spiritual ? ) After all this ,the architecture and art aren't extraordinary. The main darshan hall does have lovely golden decor and beautifully painted ceiling but then so do most big temples, along with better gardens, carving, history and less hassle. The exit is a long ,winding route through a "" big bazaar"" of religious items , books and a huge ( and yummy ) variety of food counters. There are even posters offering combo offers and discounts on various pujas ! Nope. Not my cup of tea. For peace of mind , the peaceful Isckon temple in my own city is better, thank you. For tourism , there are other , better places in Bangalore.",0
Must visit if you are a devotee of lord Krishna. Decent place to hang out with friends and family.,1
Wonderful place for soul .. nice prasadam and devotees,1
Temple maintenance good & its popular,1
"As a matter of fact the place stands for its pleasant atmosphere, a verity kind of sweets available over there, i would recommend to visit and experience it at least once.",1
"Really good ceremony inside and you can see, on the way to the interior of the temple, several Hindi Gods. Very interesting to experience how different that culture, than the european culture. The entry price is cheap. Before you go inside, you have to take off your shoes and let by the entry you bags.",1
The temple made on the hill top in the mid of Bangalore city with full of religious chanting and atmosphere provides lot of peace in the mind Visited September 2014,1
I really like,1
Good,1
"Whatever city I'm travelling I usually try going to the ISKCON and the Birla temple situated in that city so I went to ISKCON Bangalore as well. This is a huge temple situated close to the Sheraton hotel. Very nice temple, neat and clean like the other ISKCON temples. When we went it had very less crowd so had a great darshan and we got khichdi Prasad as well. Like the other ISKCON temples this temple also has a name and it is called Sri Radha Krishna temple. Do visit this place whenever you are in Bangalore. Visited August 2014",1
"Nice place, neat and clean surrounding.",1
Very refreshing & blissful experience at the entrance itself! Very clean and tidy temple which is rare in India. Laddoo Prasad is awesome! Good collection of books at the temple stores. More than satisfying experience! Must See place in Bangalore,1
"A very relaxing place to spend an afternoon with friends or family. The prayer is a must watch at any ISKCON temple, so is here at Bangalore ISKCON temple. You may also try the maha prasadam, the taste is very nice. But the connectivity to the place is not too smooth from all corners of the Bangalore city. The temple architecture is worth watching. The overall ambiance is very soul warming.",1
"Very beautiful temple ,its like small temple ,prasad is too tasty .",1
Temple is awesome but too many stall inside,0
Nice temple and its been maintained well. all facilities for people has been good..,1
"The traditionalists might frown at the concept showcased at this temple, but nevertheless, it is a wonderful visit. With intricate layout, a flight of steps that opens to a huge hall that sings glories of Krishna and Radha, it makes one go wow in wonder. the roof panels are painted with gigantic images from Krishna's life. Prasadam is available in the form of a hundred different snacks from cakes to samosas. Also worth noting is the Akshaya Patra kitchen attached to the temple that serves hot mid day meals to thousands of children across schools in Bangalore for free.The kitchen is a mammoth undertaking but very hygienic when it comes to food cooked.",0
"Positive energy is felt all around the temple, with continuous chant of 'Hare Krishna Hare Hare' from every person there. Beautiful paintings are on display. And beautiful idols.",0
"I am not one for temples & religion, etc, however I would advise you make the effort & visit if in Bangalore. It will be worthwhile & I don't think you will really ever see anything like this very often, especially considering the excellent condition that it is still in. You also have to be bare foot when walking around the grounds, you cannot take photos unfortunately & WARNING - make sure you wear trousers, otherwise you have to wear a ""towel"" like garment before you enter the grounds. Although this sounds a little extreme, I think that is why you can appreciate the architecture of this massive temple & the experience, as seeing it is more surreal than the photos you see on Google images. Visited September 2014",1
"ISKCON Temple is a must visit temple in Bangalore. The place is neat, clean, beautiful and has nice ambiance. It provides a nice view from the temple top. Temple has very good facilities in terms of Food and Restaurants. Variety of Food. Radha Krishna chanting sounds are nice and good at your ears. Weekend quality time can be spent there....",1
"ISKCON temple Bangalore, is located at the heart of city close to the Orion Mall and is worth a visit if you are visiting Bangalore. The main temple hall (Garbhgriha) has a serene & peaceful ambience and if you have time you may sit and chant the Mantras which are broadcast throughout the temple premises. Once you are done with your prayers to the deity and move ahead you get surprised by the shopping options available, like the religious/spiritual books, talismans & sweet/snack shops. The temple premises has couple of restaurants and a hotel to stay as well. It is one of the temples with parking facility.",1
"The best time to visit ISKCON is during Diwali and Janamashtami, when the entire building is decked up in lights and the festive vibe surrounds the place.",1
"There are no much places to visit in Bangalore City. But few places to visit in the city, one would be Iskon Temple. The architecture is beautiful and you can get free basic rice, sambar during lunch time. And close to the temple is the Orion mall.",1
"I've seen many ISKCON temples around the world including the birthplace near West Virginia in the US..I would highly recommend a visit to this place on your Bangalore tour...the temple architecure is really nice and well built with lots of good facilities to eat and stay around. The inside of the temple, the Krishna, Radha idols are really nicely done...",1
Good place.,1
This place is a must visit to who ever comes to Bangalore. Love the ambience and the prasad. the place is easily accessible by public transport.,1
"We visit frequently this temple and is generally crowded, given the huge fan following this temple has build up over the years.On weekend, it gets especially crowded and Saturday evening can be slight nightmare if you come with your car as getting a parking lot can be an herculean task. Taking metro can be an option now but then depends on your starting location.if you are coming with elderly people or people with disability, they have a special lift to take you close to the main temple, circumventing the long queue (but would request not to find loophole and misuse this facility).The main sanctum is amazingly decorated and one can spend hours in this place. Best way to spend sometime here, is to move away from the main darshan space and occupy the main courtyard, from where you can get a good view of the gods and also won't be pushed away by the security and temple authority. The way out of the temple has lots of art work and also the eating place (my favorite). If you are going with elderly people and kids, ensure all are moving together as the huge crowd can scatter your family members. Nice place to spend a morning or evening but may not be entire day.",1
"The temple can be seen from a distance. I was suggested to visit this place by a rickshaw driver from my hotel. I was not disappointed. I came in late afternoon. After a long and quiet queue, I entered the temple with hundreds of faithfuls. The temple is a mix between a rather modern and tradition style. Though it was rather busy with visitors, I could feel the peacefulness of the temple with the chant and smell of incents. I stayed in the main hall to do a meditation as well as observing other visitors. On the way out, I was rather surprised on the numbers of things to sell for visitors. None could resist the temptation to buy something. Though I normally I don't buy things, but I was so much tempted to try some sweets and delicacies. Most of them are way to sweet for me. My suggestion is really to find the one that suits you well. At the end of the visit, each visitor will get free food in a small cup (it's dal in a dried leaf bowl).",1
"Our taxi driver recomended this mandir as a tourist attraction. We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness, organization and quiet. The idols were very well cared for and beautifully adorned. There was a wide variety of food options at the food court. Keep it up!",1
"Really good place to pray, nearest metro is mahalaxmi station.",1
It's a good one time visit for tourists but nothing special about it. It looked like a big shopping complex to me which is themed on Lord Krishna.,0
"Situated in a 7 acre hillock, Radha krishna Temple is a sight to behold. The architectural beauty and the splendour of the temple is a feast for the eyes. Beware There will be long queues and crowds .Nice food court is also there.",1
Very well maintained temple. Pay for a priority pass to get the most value. Spiritually uplifting and well organised. Only downside is proportionally the temple tour is much smaller than the retail tour. You are forced to take a long exit past a myriad of stalls selling the usual. The restuarant looks very nice and reasonably priced but we did not stop to eat.,1
You pay to experience a barefoot walk through a 1980's temple where you can't take any photos and the main goal is to sell you something. Vendor after vendor as you walk along the set path with railings on both sides of you that guide you through the temple. You could see where this would be such a nice place if they would have not turned it into such a commercial attraction. Visited October 2014,0
Iskcon temples across have similarity in architecture and statues of deity. Lord Krishna with Radha is amazing and the place is peaceful.,1

This place is so clean and organised. As soon as you enter a blanket of peace takes over. The evening aarti is mesmerizing i just went in trance. You dont feel like leaving the place. I heard the prasadam is great too though i could not have it myself. Beautiful experience.,1
Highly commercial place. Rated 2 stars only for the ambiance.,0
"Very modern. all made of marble and very organized. Do not take shoes in hand, because as every Indian temple, only allows entry barefoot. If you take shoes in hand and will charge to Garda them and will not let u keep in your purse / backpack. Has an unpleasant smell and recording Crishna rare ends with the patience of anyone. At the end of the tour has a guard that forces you to go through the shop.",0
Nice place for all devotional people,1
Good place to visit. One of the best temples of Bangalore. Morning time is better as evenings tends to get a little rush.,1
"A great holy place. The temple is dedicated to lord Krishna. The atmosphere is good & pure would make you feel so good. Everybody is just singing the lord krishna songs, The arti is something must to watch & the prasad is also great. A peaceful place.",0
Wonderful spiritual place.. RS 300 allow 6 people for direct entry and also will get special Pooja entry ...and food court will do many varieties of snacks..,1
Excellent temple but too many stairs and poorly managed during rain and can be hazardous. Also needs wheel chair access to help all devotees get to the core temple!,1
Temple is nice to visit. There is a room for improvement for orderly allowing the visitors. Marketing to be done in a separate place and It should not be forced / make compulsory the devotees / visitors to sail through the marketing place. Temple building should be used exclusively for devotional purposes.,0
Hare sri krishna ...... what a temple an awesome outlook ..... went to bangaaaallore for a day trip on September good aas a nice experience,1
The complex is fantastic and very welcoming. I was lucky to have a driver for the day who would give me more incite into the rituals I was seeing. Although not religious in the slightest I'm always interested in seeing the customs of the places I visit. This temple is a great place to start when visiting Bangalore.,1
Location wise excellent and situated in hill top and nice pleasant climate can be enjoyed in this temple.,1
"I recently came to Bangalore on business for two weeks, my first time ever travelling outside of the US. Some of my co-workers took me to do site-seeing over the weekend, and I asked them to show me things that represented Bangalore and the culture here. The Iskcon Temple was the first place they took me. My impression of this place is almost indescribable. It's beauty is absolutely breathtaking, and that's not even touching on the overwhelming feeling of peace when you're inside. By far, my favorite place of everywhere that I went in Bangalore. An experience you don't want to miss.",1
In my opinion Iskon Bangalore temple is one of the best. You will fall in love with god krishna after visiting this temple. Everything is fine,1
"A beautiful temple of Krishna..temples for all the avatars of Vishnu,the permanent broadcast of the chanting of 'HareRamaHareKrishna' makes one drawn towards God...marble steps, beautiful architecture,the paintings is all splendid.The way they allow the people to move in a proper way makes it very pleasant.The sanctum of the gods beautifully decorated.There are small stalls where one can buy sweets,prasad,etc all made in the temple kitchen! Plenty of divine books of Krishna are available in all languages, must buy are little Krishna t shirts Kurta's for kids,There are souvenirs to buy.usualy a good prasadam is given it's simple and tasty.There is a veg restaurant where food ,snacks are available.Ample parking space is available.One can become member and you get some special privileges like you can go for special pujas on yr birthday, anniversary etc.Outside the fountain etc all are well maintained.It takes a special form as evening approaches,the lights etc gives it a magical mystical divine feeling!.",1
"Must visit when you are in bangaluru. It closed between 12 to 4 pm, so visit accordingly. They have seprate line for VIP visitors for a nominal charge for fast visit.",1
Really Nice temple. And cleanest temple I ever seen.,1
Pleasant and very well maintained. You'll get wide variety in food stall as Prasad. More than a temple :-),1
"Its a good temple. Its near Mahalakshmi layout, Bangalore. Radha and Krishna are worshipped. Its near to Majestic, Bangalore",1
"I have been to several ISKCON mandirs in my life, but never did get such essence of commercialisation as I found here. The area is big, the inside of the temple is like any other ISKCON temple, with shiny clean and decorated interiors and lovely idol of Sri Krishna, Radha and other Gods and Goddesses. There is a sitting statue of Sri Prabhupada , as in other ISKCON temples. But what distinguishes this Bangalore temple from other ISKCON temples is the number of shops inside it. Too many if them.....looks like a religious shopping mall ! It was painful to my eyes to see such business oriented approach in a ISKCON temple....actually I was not habituated with such thing as per my experiences in other ISKCON temples. Jay Sri Krishna, Jay Radhhe.....!",0
"Clean and tidy, well maintained.",1
The temple looks marvelous and stunning. One enjoys the chanting and calmness inside the temple. They have may shops where you can buy spiritual books.,1
"The temple is very well maintained. It's spotlessly clean and is being built in the recent times. Dedicated to Lord Krishna and Radhaji, this temple is a Krishna cult temple. Aarti is being preformed here every morning and evening. Aarti is a lively worship of the deities by the entire devotees group singing bhajans and chanting Krishna mantras.",1
"They had all the amenities, but it was more like a commercial place than just a temple. The darshan experience was very good",1
The place is very organised and maintained exceptionally well. Please note that photography is not allowed inside the temple.,1
"The temple is good place to spend a peaceful evening. It is well managed, clean and the also offer food at certain times of the day.",1
"Temple is built in modern way ,the whole functionality is very systematic . Overall good place to go..",1
You don't want to miss out to visit this at least once if you are very new to bangalore or came for a short trip to the city. Must visit. It hosts crowd so might not want to plan anything for the day you visit this temple.,1
"Spiritual and silent . Well cleaned , deciplaned . And well staff helps to visitors . And very attractive place .",1
One of the big Temple in Bangalore and nice place to see many God in one Temple,1
Serene and blissful environs. AkshayPatra is the largest free-serving kitchen program run by Isckon in the world!,1
"Neat place. Crowded at times. Too crowded sometimes! But, a different type of a temple to visit. Super!",1
"Very well located on a tiny hillock, this abode of Krishna is mesmerizing especially in the early mornings with just a whiff of sunlight on this beautiful temple.",1
"An architectural masterpiece. A landmark for the city. A must visit for all people alike. The entire place literally transports you to a different world, full of devotion and reflection. The entire temple complex would need to be consumed through your eyes, mind and spirit, and this would need plenty of time, patience, bhakti and energy. The main prayer hall is huge and is an experience to sit through bhajans and/or pooja performances. Books, trinkets, take aways, and a myriad other Krshna products along with the rosaries and the prasadam can well be very good souvenirs for posterity. There are lots of shops selling t shirts to pens to food and one could pay attention to how they relate to the KRSHNA Consciousness and purchase accordingly. It can be quite annoying if someone is not ready, when volunteers seek donation for their several food schemes. If you have the time, just as you step out, you may seek to visit their Akshaya Patra operations area to see the massive meal scheme they run to feed millions of children. Amazing work! Amazing place! A must visit for everybody.",1
Excellent place...It can take away your sadness.Specially The Plate in Entrance.It's a place to check your patience.J... View and reply,1
Awesome visit,1
"The road leading to the place is always dense with traffic. However once you enter the premises, it is fine. Parking space is available. There is a high class restaurant too. The problem is for all those who find it difficult to walk due to old age or obesity or such other reasons since the the whole area including the temple building itself are not in a plain plane and one has to walk up and down the roads or stairs. Even the temple is built at various levels. In some portions, lifts are there ur it would be impossible to avoid altogether climbing up & down.",0
After the whole days sightseeing...the best place to spend your evening in such a divine place. very beautiful view at night and the feel of the surroundings is mesmerizing. would love to visit here again.,1
peace place with god blessings...,1
"Its a must visit. everything is so orderly, so different from many religious places in India. Very clean and well maintained.",1
This temple is one of the best ISKCON I have ever seen before...great ambiance and service. Must visit place in Bangalore,1
The only thing I disliked about the temple is that it is kind of commercialized. But the divinity across the temple still remains the same.,1
"We the team of 6 people visited the ISKCON, bangalore temple last week. it was a wonderful experience. It is a place of bliss. Jai Sri Krishna",1
This is all time favorite place in Bangalore. A must visit place in Bangalore which i recommend everyone to go,1
"Very commercialized temple. Huge crowd on any occasion but still the management is good. They have steps to reach the main temple which is in a count of 108. Every step you are supposed to repeat: ""hare Krishna hare Krishna, Krishna-Krishna hare hare, hare rama-hare rama, rama-rama hare hare!"" Gives a feel of modern temples.",1
Went with my parents and the experience quite Devine. Never expected such a big place in mid of the city. The temple is quite humongous. It's really systematic clean and properly managed by the temple committee. Overall a very nice soothing place to medicate and pray.,1
really nice temple. iskon has really nice radhe krishna temple world wide.,1
GOD PLACE WITH CLEAN & SPIRITUAL ATMOSPHERE..,1
"There is no bar on caste, creed or sex to visit this temple. It is prevalent in other temples. Lord Krishna is worshiped mainly through bhajans. No prior experience is required to chant these soothing syllables. Its takes about 30 to 45 minutes to have a glimpse of all decked up Gods & appreciate the temple architecture. You have an opportunity to carry the details of Gods in the form of books, cds etc., Next and the last thing is the delicious edibles... Its completely vegetarian & also cooked without onion & garlic; but the varieties are amazing... ""Krishna Prasad"" is delicious...",1
Nice and peaceful,1
"Good to get some devotional light from Lord Krishna. Well maintained, clean, Cleaner Air, Air Conditioned Venue. The only thing i didn't like it in this venue is there is no quicker exit after completing the prayers to Lord Krisha. The exit is long, leading to shops setup by ISKON. You essentially gotta go through each and every shop before you exit. More than a Temple, I got the feeling of being in a Supermarket built around a Temple.",0
"It is a Decent Place to visit.nicely organised,clean and serene. But for me it did not give me a feel that i was inside a Temple.may be my perception of a temple is different being a guy from coastal Karnataka( south west of India).",0
Nice and we'll maintained temple,1
"It needs to deposit backpack and camera, not good for tourists.",0
"I love the way of sculpture , construction looks like BRUNDAWANAM",1
"Located at Rajajinagar, Built over a Hill (Hare Krishna Hill), this ISKCON Sri Sri Radha Krishna Chandra temple is one of the biggest ones with an amazing blend of modern + old architecture. Opulent Deities of Sri Lakshmi Narasimha, Sri Garudadev & Sri Hanuman, Sri Srinivasa Govinda, Sri Sri Radha Krishna Chandra, Sri Sri Krishna Balaram, Sri Panca Tattva, Srila Prabhupada are a delight to have darshan of. A must visit for all ages alike, specials on Sundays and festivals. One can do spiritual shopping, have sumptuous sattvik prasadam at the stalls or even at the two restaurants which are located in the premises, one can enjoy nice chanting and meditation, listen to nice spiritual kirtans & lectures, watch movies on Krishna,.",1
"please try & visit lord Krishna iskon temple which is west-off cross road near by metro,well maintained, open in two secession,they have hall for celebration,where charges are very nominal....thanks to bangalore iskon Visited June 2014",1
"Everytym I visit this temple, I cum out wid sumting new & enriching..!! Feels so different & spiritual.!!! :):):) Hare Krishna!!! :):):)",1
I had heard a lot about the ISKCON temple in bangalore and finally got a chance to visit.. beautiful temple on a hill overlooking the city. must visit..,1
I love this place,1
Good place,1
"Just in one line - very nice place to visit, should not miss.Nicely developed, maintained, lots of people to guide and help you",0
"It was a very big campus the idol of the god was very big. there was one very big temple and the others were small ones. There were ample food options. The decoration of the main temple is eye catching, after visiting the temple you will get some peace.",1
"It is really a gorgeous and most beautiful temple in Bangalore and offers the most attractive religious views that touch the heart. Here for ISKCON temple, you can book the cab from Bharat Taxi which making available the taxi services for entire the city of Bangalore.",1
"Huge and very impressive temple high up in Bangalore. Don't take a camera or wear shorts - as you'll be pulled out of line and dressed in a dhoti. Temple was busy when we went, just as it opened in the afternoon, queues quite long, but worth the wait.",1
good place,1
Must visit place in Bangalore. Don't miss the temple look from outside in lights after 6-7PM. Bit negative is it will look commercial once completed the krishna Darshan and entered to shopping area.,1
Nice clean and spacious Temple. U get ultimate peace of mind. Strict outfits rules which are thumbs up.,1
Awesome place,1
"A brilliant piece of work, Sprawling campus with over bridges and proper arrangements for Darshan, You may also get free bhog at afternoon from 11.30 - 2.00 pm. Evening aarti is a must see.",1
The temple is beautiful! It has a very large built up area. The carvings on are really good. You can sit here for as ...,1
good temple,1
Very nice place to visit god nice food iddli dossa and Jammun were nice,1
Superb Temple in Bangalore. But please take care of quality of the food.,1
This is a place of devotion to worship lord Krishna peaceful place very helpful for handicaps wheel chair facility is there,1
The temple which is ever seen in my life.too good which is in Bangalore.i went with my family and i enjoyed a lot.everyone have to visit this temple.simply suberb and awesome.,1
People are more fond about architecture of malls nowadays. I feel that is reason for this modern age temple to be constructed with a lot of shopping stalls within the premise. Also a food court is available similar to malls. Coming to the temple it is a very maintained divine place that looks posh. There is concept that every person visiting this temple will have to say or at least to listen before proceeding to next step a mantra. This is repeated for 108 times and feels good. Once you reach the temple shrine the Idols are decorated beautifully and gives a divine feeling. When you start to decent there are shopping stalls to buy devotional items at the end of which you will find food court as well. There is even a small theater that runs 3D show of little krishna for kids especially. On the whole it is a modern age architecture that combined a Temple and mall together.,1
One of the best temples in Bangalore. Hare Rama Hare Krishna...,1
Hare krishnna,1
Great place for worship,1
peaceful place,1
"ISKCON, it is temple for body, mind and soul...Visit and Experience it......",1
"Make the time to see this landmark, it really is better in person as its details are so immense that most visitors leave saying ""Wow"".",1
Hare Hare!! ISKCON Rajajinagar one of the finest designed temples. The ceiling carved with pictures of Krishna are very pleasing to eyes. The main temple sanctum has high positive energy and vibes. We as a society lack self discipline and that creates chaos in the temple. The guards have to run around to stop people from photographing. The only thing which I don't prefer in a place of worship is commercial sales. One can definitely provide religious literature and books in and around the temple but selling merchandise on multiple counters like market doesn't go well within the temple. There can be a dedicated area for these commercial activities. People who go to visit temple must be given direct entry and exit without forcing them go through all these sales counters. Jai Shree Krishna,0
Too artificial and given too much importance. I did not enjoy the different controls established before you can get intothe temple. I like more humble things. Visited June 2014,0
A very neat & clean temple inspite of the rush of devotees. It felt as if I was spiritually connected to God.If you are in Bangalore then you should certainly visit this temple,1
"I always visit here when i reach banglore.. one of the place where you can find peace in mind. Interested people can indulge in more religious offerings, but i like this place specially for sitting simply and closing your eyes.",1
"Looks great, especially at night with all the lighting on the grand structure of the temple. Can get exhausting climbing all the way up and down though. No distinct religious feel to the place as such though.",0
Good commercialization of Krishna.,0
Very very beautiful place and Very neatness....,1
Its a Wonderful Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Bangalore It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world . i went with my family members. very peaceful place and i really felt the same.The inside of the temple is mesmerizing.Foreigners also allowed.Strict security and dress code maintained.i really enjoyed a LOT!!!,1
"This place is right in the middle of a busy place, but once you enter the temple, you will feel that you are in a different world. Very well maintained place and a place for peace loving people. Of course it's spiritual too, A darshan of God will swipe away all your worries and bring you back happiness.",1
Beautiful place,1
surrender completely unto the lotus feet of GOVINDA. Stay happy the way he keeps bcos he ensures the best for his devotees,1
"A place to visit for Krishna lovers, others can enjoy the architecture and designs. There are shops for purchase but are quite costly. Lengthy q for darshan.",1
One of bangalore's famous landmarks. A must visit n experience the grandeur with which Pooja and bhajans are performed here.,1
"Ce temple est magique. Une immersion totale dans la religion Indou, un cadre majestueux.... √† ne pas louper √† Bangalore!",1
"While the route from the entrance to the sanctum keeps you immersed in the hare krishna chantings, the main temple just transfers you the divine loka. The three altars in the main temple have their own incredible positive vibes. The arati at 8.30 pm is just an experience that is magical. A huge super market of a different kind where you will be feeling it difficult to make a choice of what not to buy - from rosaries- books, apparel, incense, watches, organic food and a beautiful spread of many authentic, safe and pure snacks and juices and are quite affordable.",1
Clean,1
this is one of the biggest temple in Bangalore but everything is commercial there. Good place for time pass and snacks,0
We had a divine experience. There is a lift for physically handicapped to avoid the stairs. My FIL is blind so we used the lift facility. Overall its a nice temple to visit,1
"Very crowded and commercial. They have maintained the premises very well, but the place feels very commercial. Not a very peaceful darshan. If you end up going on a busy day, you'll feel rushed",0
A beautiful temple. Very nicely built and kept clean. The greenery around is also well maintained. A must visit for all.,1
Radhe Radhe....Its very peaceful place and an must visit place from this busy life and beautifully maintained?,1

"Great and spiritual temple. Be ready to ear and participate of the hindu tradition.. Good place to learn a lot about religion and spiritualism, and to buy some nice souvenirs. Great vibe as you can witness live chanting and instrument play on the actual praying room. Fridays are very auspicious days so if you can be sure to save some time to visit... Very recommended--- :)",1

"The man who I presume is the owner booked us. He is incredibly nice. True, communal bathrooms and few electrical outlets are different but for what we paid, it doesn't matter.",1
The temple has beautiful architecture with high level of cleanliness and maintenance. The place is beautiful and serene. Its queuing system is well organized to avoid over crowding. Finally the food being provided there is too delicious.,1
"I had visited this temple with family many times and feel like visiting it often. The whole atmosphere is divine, it is managed very well. Unlike the temples I had been to in North India, this one is peaceful, filled with holy air and let's one dwell into one's own self. A must visit for everyone visiting Bangalore city..",1
this temple is situated on the hare krishna hills in the rajajinagar west of chord road near yeshwantpur railway station this is one of the finest krishna temple in india and must visit if you are in the bangalore they serve very good veg satvik food,1

Best place in Bangalore for Peace.,1
It is really very nice visit. very peaceful & very clean. Gold plated kalash shikara & flag post. There is free distribution of Sri Krishna prasadam to all visitors during the darshana hours. The temple is open from 4:15 am to 5:00 am,1
"The place is completely commercialized as you exit the main part of the temple darshan right from the stairs and you will feel like a mall itself. All said, the place is awesome to visit as you will for sure get a peaceful feeling... Hare Rama Hare Krishna",1
Its near to metro station or you can book ola/uber to get here. Watch little krishna in the theater. Kheer prasadam is a must to have here.,1
"located in a very busy area, this temple is big and peaceful. Its bigger than the one compared to the mumbai one. Its usually crowed on weekends, but worth visiting once",1
"This is a Amazing place ,u feel so much peace and a divine ... Hare Krishna Hare Krishna!!!",1
"First of all you need to deposit your footwear at the ground floor. Then you have to cross the shopping centre to ultimately reach the temple which is at the top floor. You will get all types of things relate dto lord krishna and also foood! there is a 7d theatre, a restaurant, shopping amenities like gita and other lord krishna related books and various other things. And the most interesting part is that to collect your shoes you need to go through all of these. Quite a temple!!",1
"The atmosphere transports us to the spiritual realm just with the purity in the environment. It has cleanliness, hygiene, friendly inmates, delicious delicacies and soul stirring praises. Best day and time to visit: Sunday 7 AM.",1
it was so spiritual and I feel really good when I visit this place. People should visit and then feel the experience.,1
"Well, it is curious to see, even a temple without any history and Bangalore and neither can go to see anything much better",0
Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare.,1
Very well maintained with nice atmosphere. A wide range of food options are also available!,1
"This was first time i visited an ISKCON temple. I was breath-taken by the its beauty. As one goes inside one is mesmerized by the beauty, size and peace the temple offers. There is inhouse cafe which is also good. A must visit in Bengaluru.",1

"One best Temple in Bangalore to visit, good atmosphere",1
Nice place,1
"Good: the shrines(there are 3), water fountains and lots of gold. Bad: the queue and the commercialism",1
A beautiful calm and well maintained peace filled relaxed place in Bangalore and must visit to get Lord Sri Krishna blessings,1
The temple is very well made with both Interior and exterior at its best...Had been to ISKCON Temple in Bangalore many times. You will see all well educated Dasas managing the temple. the Chanting of Hare Krishna Hare Rama inside the temple will take you to a different world. A must visit for anyone who believe in Hindusim and Lord Krishna...,1
Good place..positive vibes all over..,1
"One of the top best spirituality places to visit in Bangalore,that includes Krishna Temple,Meditation place,shopping,...",1
Been to this place with my family and it was such a nice trip. The place was not so crowded when i visited.After a short walk through a narrow queue you can reach the Lord Venkateswara temple and further walk leads you to radha-krishna temple. The interesting story is the temple is well maintained and clean. Fact i learned is that the idols are decorated with costumes designed and tailored by Islamic craftsman. They serve free food as well. Good amount of parking space is available and is walk-able from Orion mall.,1
"Upon entering the site where the temple is built it soon becomes clear that we have entered a dimension very structured and organized. Accessed obviously without shoes as in all temples in India, strictly following a planned route to get to Darshan in the main room in an orderly manner. Very modern compared to traditional temples, there are many interesting statues of the gods, but the main room is a magnificence almost touching. If you are lucky you can watch the puja and stay listening to devotional songs that take place inside. We then carry on to the exit through the lower floors where wind a series of banquets and shops where you can buy everything to end with an airy restaurant truly exceptional both in taste and in cleaning and exit overlooking the fountain with the sacred food by taste. I highly recommend a visit.",1
This is one of the largest temple of ISKON society and also one of worth visiting places in Banglore.Just like the others it is also unique and beautiful inside. One can have a pleasant visit to this temple with friends and family . Other places nearby are few malls like orien mall and pvr vaishnavi,1
"Visit here for some clean good veg meals, snacks and go round the beautiful structure and enjoy the chanting",1
It is simply outstanding..A must visit..,1
I like to come an se this kovil,1
one of favorite places from childhood best place temple is beautiful and neatly maintained,1
A very beautiful temple. Well maintained and has good views from the top. The food here is a must try and is reasonably priced.,1
Divine and heavenly. Very neat and serene atmosphere. But one thing I do not agree is the forced sale of various products inside the temple. Visited June 2014,1
Hare Rama hare Krishna. Blessed to be with Lord Krishna wonderful darshan.,1
Tranquility in the midst of the busiest place. A place worth for visit! #Lord Krishna_Bengaluru,1
Not a typical Indian temple. I felt more like a business place,0
"When you visit this temple make sure there is some festivals or some special pooja timings in the temple, you will have a real vibrant celebration at this time of hours. The prayers and pooja performed is a hair raising experience. You will feel enchanted and refreshed after the event and will be satisfied with the happening out there. If you walk need to climb around 200 steps or little more, other option been drive up the artificial hill but still you would need to walk around 50 odd steps.",1
Peace full place,1
The atmosphere around the temple is so peaceful and beautiful,1
Really beautiful,1
temple is very big..............u have to visit one time if u go there......bad point is that they make temple like buisness point more space is uses for selling there products,1
Good,1
Holy Godly place,1
The place is located at a very calm and peaceful surroundings. The construction is very good and the overall feeling of [eace dawns upon you one you are inside. A must visit for anyone who hasnt visited. I did dislike the overtly in-your-face donation asking strategy of the Mgmt Authorities. also they force you to visit the shopping arcade uneccesarily. Visited September 2013,0
"1.Best time to visit 7 15 am - 8 30 am or 7:45 pm to 8 :20 pm during arati session. Temple is closed between 1 pm to 4 pm. 2.Senior citizens can opt for lift facility . Wheel chairs available for physically challenged. 3.Paid Shuttle autos from entrance for those who can't walk ( not very sure. Ask the security or call temple. If you are coming by auto or uber you can ask them to drop up the hill they will allow without parking fee. If you have a private vehicle it's very good. Nevertheless it's a good exercise for people coming by metro or bus) 4. Direct exit for people not interested in shopping. There is a clear big LED board which shows direction for direct exit. Many people are complaining that you are forced into stalls. Nobody forces. There is an exit and you should just take that. 5. Buying books paraphernalia etc is optional. Again for those who feel it is a commercial shopping complex you can just take lift or walk away from counters. However their books are amazing and very inspiring. 6. Lot of books and things to engage school going kids into God consciousness. 7. Free meal everyday 11am to 2pm 8. Free Donna (cup) prasada of steaming hot kichidi. You can ask for any number they don't mind. 9. Weekdays you can have peaceful darshan for a longer time 10. You can buy tickets for a queue free closer darshan 11. Clean toilet facilities provided backside of temple 12. All prasadam ( pastries puffs) items are free of onion garlic and eggs obviously 13. Enquire about events in the temple like youth programs , summer camps etc. If you are interested. 14. On certain festivals like Narsimha jayanthi, panihati etc ( you can get to know thru their website about upcoming festivals) the evenings are marvellous. Must visit festival evenings at 6 30pm usually in the open air theatre. 15. Observe the way the Deities are decorated. I am sure no temple in Bangalore have such nice outfits and such decoration for deities that too EVERYDAY. 16. Car park, Guest house, Higher taste restaurant, animated movie Little Krishna shows, pooja paraphernalia, authentic books based on Scriptures, coloring books, kids books, school stuff, bakery... Many more. 17. If you donate even a rupee here, it is completely worth as they spend on free midday meals to school kids all over India. And their transactions are clear so you don't have to worry whether somebody is eating you money. They use all donations for seva of Lord. 18. Anybody can visit temple irrespective of race caste creed. No shorts allowed. U can rent dhoti.",1
One Must Visit this place. Very Beautiful place. This Temple offers you that peace that one looks for,1
Very nice temple is good & more devoshanal,1
One of the biggest and good temple in the city. Most visiting temple for learning and for peace of mind. My request. Please visit the temple and seek blessings of lord krishna. Hare rama hare krishna,1
"The temple has a unique way to calm down your temper. You must visit this temple whenever you are in Bangalore, the 108 times, chanting of Hare Krisna and Hare Rama before you visit the temple, clams you down from hectic city life. You must not miss the evening prayers. Be there by 6 PM so as to reach in time for Aarti. Visited October 2014",1
It's a good temple to visit. You should go their early in the morning as there is a big queue . You can also opt for the paid darshan line,0
Peaceful A tad too far...only accessible during weekends for people staying closer to South Bangalore. Not so comfortable with the mix of business and worship!! Atmosphere is silent and calm. Very soothing experience.,1
"To my mind Iskcon Temple Bangalore is one of the best Hare Rama Hare Krishna Temple which I have visited. Lord Krishna is same every where but when I say excellent means decor of temple, infrastructure, cleanliness, temple staff behavior, discipline, security etc.",1
"The temple may look hi tech from outside, but inside with a vast prayer hall its good place to sit and meditate... the chanting makes it more spiritual...",1
it was my wedding anniversary and i visited this temple for the first time. We were in time for the aarti and it was a wonderfully divine feeling. The 108 steps you pass while chanting at each step was a moving feeling. A place you feel where God actually resides. a very well organised institute. A place you can't miss if you are in Bangalore,1
"Very good spiritual place. Though appears a bit commercialized, it is well managed. It's a very beautifully made architecture",1
One of the mush watch temples in and around Bangalore. Had a great experience. Also had a small shopping for bhagavat geeta books.,1
"Whenever you are in Bengaluru either on business or family trip, a visit to Iskon is a must. You will feel blessed and your visit will inspire you.",1
The temple is huge very clean and the deities are amazing. the only negative point is you have to pay to get inside while i tend to think that walking in a temple should be free. But i certainly understand that there could be a cost for maintaining such a divine place. Prasad and coupons to purchase books was freely offered though. Unfortunately cameras were not allowed and even bags had to be kept at security.

"Iskon Temple is a temple with difference. Unlike any other traditional temple, it is very neat & clean. Need not to buy any ticket. You will get of peace of mind.There is lift available for elderly people. There is good vegetarian restaurant ( but little expensive).",1
"Its a nice temple. Very well organised and everyone is supposed to be in a line. Noone pushes and therefore, one can get a good darshan. Eateries are also available once the darshans are done. Nice view from the top as well.",1
A nice place to visit. The last aarti at 8.3o pm was really glamorous. You can also take special entry tickets to get a better view and they also give books and prasadam along with it. They give prasadam to every devotee who visit the place. It has a lot of stalls varying from foods to varied articles. Really a nice experience.,1
"good place, to know Radhika devi dasi passed from this world by the blessings of Guru and Gouranga on Radhastami at 5:05 pm. She had a look of rapture on her face as if she had darshan of Sri Krishna! She is a beacon for all of us. Thank You Srimati Radharani!",1
We have visited the temple during the time of sunset. They lights of the temple were turning on. We enjoyed the whole lighting including the sunsets from the hill of the temple. I also suggest people to visit the temple during the starting of evening period.,1
"This temple is very different in a way that is it is made in ascending order. like when u start from 108 manka mala first temple is Narsingh avtar then one more temple of vishnu avtara and then Tirupati Balaji then you will reach to the main temple where Krishna is sitting with Radha and Balaram and his friends. paintings on the roof are amazing and mandir is very well maintained. I have seen Iskon from Vrindavan but comparative to that this is very spacious. prasad they give is also very tasty and whatever north indian pooja book you are not getting in Bangalore, you will get there. so my experience was good. I prefer to go again. Visited March 2014",1
"This place is a very nice tourist attraction in bangalore. The entrance is free, pay only if you want to take snaps inside the temple complex. The prasadam is delicious. It's good they now allow you to exit directly without having to go through the food stall and shopping area.",1
This temple of Lord Krishna is Beautiful. The architecture is awesome. You would feel peaceful. There is option for some shopping and food.,1
This Iskcon is as nice as any other Iskcon I have seen in the world. It has a restaurant with amazing indian food.,1
"ISKON Hare Krishna Temple is a magnificent, modern, yet ancient looking, intricately designed temple, with the main deity being Lord Sri Radha Krishna. It is not only a temple of many deities, but also a charitable institute and a cultural center. The other main deities are Krishna Balarama, Nitai Gauranga, Srinivasa Govinda and Prahlada Narasimha! One can read about the stories about these deities that easily takes you to the Satyayuga and Dwapara Yuga. The decoration of the statue is intricately done and looks most beautiful. Even non-believers may turn into believers on seeing the smiling Lord Krishna with Goddess Radha. ISKON Bangalore ""Akshaya-Patra"" program supports several 100's of schools around Bangalore city and rural areas with sumptuous, nutrition rich, hot, freshly cooked afternoon meals. Their kitchen is massive and for 1000's of kids! You may please donate for this cause. ISKON also supports Gow-Rasha (Cow Protection) and has Gow-Shalas... ISKON also provides used clothes, but in good condition, to many destitute and poor people. If you have any used clothes (not torn and stained) in good condition, please donate them to ISKON, Bangalore. If you are a Bangalorean, a weekly visit is a must to this temple.",1
Will not compare it with other Iskons but you can visit this place with family. The food lane after temple visit is tempting. Also prasada offered is also pretty decent. All in all you can visit this when your parents and relatives are in town,0
"Visiting this Temple allowed us to think about our own beliefs and what it means to believe. We were impressed by its efficiency... ticket, shoes, borrowing dhotis (heads up, it has dressing rules- no exposed knees or legs. We had to deposit 1000 rupees to borrow their dhotis), and admiring several temples as we climbed up. It concluded with many gift shops, concession stands, and book shops. Lots of people were there as is not uncommon wherever you go in India. In sum, the whole experience was different and it was in some way exhilarating. I would recommend checking it out if you are interested in knowing more about Hinduism and what they do there- a total cultural experience with a hint of tourism.",1
"I have visited Iskcon in June 2015 last week. Temple was so beautiful, peaceful and fully organized. Also stayed in Iskcon guest house which was very clean and nice.",1
Classic,0
Superr,1
"Good Place but feels more commercial than devotional, it all started when start your visit, you will be handed over parking charge receipt, once you start in line everywhere you can see the paid Darshana boards. When you are inside temple people will start selling devotional books right from the inside of main temple. For exit you have to cross almost all the shops. Good part is the place is located centrally to Bangalore, easy to reach by Metro. If you leacve commercialization aside, temple itself is very beautiful.",0
"It is situated on main Tumkur Road .A vary big temple with lot of stairs.Statues are nice, a worth visiting for Krishna lovers.",1
Nice place to visit and to understand the country culture. Very neat and peaceful place. Must visit in Bangalore,1
I had gone there early morning and was one of the first visitors that day. The art and architecture inside the temple premises is great. A lot of steps need to be climbed and is located above the city level. Great view of the city from the top of the temple. Located close to the Orion Mall. The temple is well maintained and you would be lost in another world when you enter the main temple. It creates an aura of silence and devotion.,1
Really awesome Place... Hare Rama Hare Krishna..... Krishna Krishna Hare Hare!!!!!,1
One of my favorite Temple,1
Very nice environment.....radhe krisna temple,1
"Very Impressive Both the building and the ceremony Note that you need to take of the shoes before entering, better come with socks and not walk bare foot... Recommend visiting , if you are in bangaluru",1
"Temple is on the outskirts of the city but worthwhile of all the traffic tolls on your health. It is very clean and calm place, the architecture and the paintings on ceilings are very good. Overall good place to visit.",1
I never Seen Such A Devotional Atmosphere .... Every wer you Hear the Sound Vibration of Hare Krishna Sung By Srila Prabupada... this is most Lovable Place for Krishna Devotees !!!,1
"A temple dedicated to lord krishna, love to visit here. And khichidi prasad is awesome.",1
Right now I started my job that became service for Krishna when I get time book distribution and preaching to the people about Krishna following prabhupada instruction chanting 16 round hearing waiting for service everyday so I want join in devotional service,1
Bahut sundar vyavastha hai.sree radhakrishn ke charno men hamari priti ho. Jai radhe krishna.,1
Something we feel different after chanting the words of krishna for 108 times while crossing the 108 steps.............Even though temple is too commercialised I am so excited by seeing the excellent old traidition...........morning 4:15 Am Dharsan is so marvelous I didnt see tht type of dharsan anywhere in my life ...,1
"Very beautiful place, one can feel the positive vibes in the vicinity",1
A Peacefull place to visit on weekend,1
Truly a very calm place to visit. Get away from the busy schedule and worship God and take his blessings. A very nice place with lots of positive energy,1
Hare krishna,1
Jai shri radhe kishan,1
"It's an awesome place, Will feel blessed..........",1
When I visit this temple I found it very spiritual and peaceful temple...The aratis are amazing...one can find any item/food from the shops available within the premises of the temple....must place to visit,1
the temple is vry crowded and the food is not hygenic everything is open bot its a good view.the secnery is nice its like a heaven,0
Nice architecture . It's a unique Temple for me.,1
One of largest iskcon temples. Filled with traditional atmosphere.,1
"ts more commercial complex, than it showcases as a temple!!! * By the time you enter and park your vehicle, you'll be charged for parking! Paying for parking at a temple! Are you serious!! * Bhagavadgita book which costs 40Rs. near my home, costs 105Rs. there. * Many photos, souvenirs, etc all highly priced. * Tirupati offers 2 Big Laddus for 50Rs including ticket cost and it cost 30Rs. for one small pack here. I mean what's the point? * There is no way to bypass prasadam queue, which is totally filled to the top of stairs, if you are to go out without it, annoyed of the queue! * By the time you go out, you'll see more stalls and sales men pitching for different things than God :) But the architecture is good and Krishna idol inside is in Northern style. Once you step in its peaceful and no one asks to vacate the place as they do in Tirupati :) Venkateshwara and Narasimha are a must see, as they look gorgeous with all Diamond embedded Murthy. Really a great moment to stand there. Good to go once!",0
"Interesting temple where you can witness all the local services, feel the atmosphere of prayers. Thee is a special entrance for tourists (tickets) aloowing visisting without queue.",1
"Second visit to this unlikely temple standing in the middle of the buildings. It is recommended for men and women to cover the legs and shoulders before you go and leave his cigarettes in the car as they will be confiscated. 300r for 3 people, for a break that you entered in the middle of the tumult, it's worth it! To have !!!",1
"Nice Devotional pace , gives calmness to heart and mind",1
"We generally like the architecture and the beauty of structure of ISKCON temples across India . We make it a point to visit the temple if present in he city we travel. This was the second visit to ISKCON Bangalore . This is one of the major and big ones in the city itself near Mysore sandal soap company . Near to metro and nearly Orion mall. The temple is well maintained and has Tirupathi Balaji and prahaladha Narasimha deities apart from the main deity of Krishna . They have good parking facility . The main temple is wonderfully architected. As always as any other ISKCON, it has a lot of stalls for sales of books and other stuff . There was a book stall near the darshan place , which could have been avoided for free movement of pilgrims after darshan . Also the free Prasadam place is little crampy , as the queue gets formed on the stairs . Free lunch tokens are provided when you go in the afternoon time . From 11 : 30 to 2:30",1
"I don't like the shopping area being there in the temple.. It makes it a market selling, cake , samosa etc Who sells ...",0
Good place in bangalore to seat for a long hour. I prefer to be here from morning 8 am onwards. Weekend is very much crowded,1
The temple is built over a hillock. The temple is well organized and clean.Food is sold for a price (other than free prasadam that is given after Darshan) and the food is tasty. However the divinity that one sees in other temples is missing and the environment is more commercial.,0
Wow watta amazing temple by krishna devotees. Bigger and wonderful.,1
"The green environment welcomes into unique glass architecture reflecting the blue color of sky, The melodious chanting of lord krishna brings you out from stress and depression and gives you feeling of gods lap , We can find hundreds of book collection and you can grab out various different articles in the stores...!",1
"This a great divine place, suggested for people of all age group. I actually feel spiritual, everytime i have been there. very very well maintained, good crowd management. It also has a open eatout area at the basement of the temple. A must visit for people who come to visit bangalore. It's really an icon for bangalore",1
"Sri Radha Krishna Temple has deities of Radha and Krishna located at Rajajinagar, in North Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world. I visited this temple with my family.The temple is soo neat and clean.all the devotees are following line and it makes happy to visit the god for more time.",1
"If you are a 1st timer in Bangalore and wondering what Bangalore can offer other than pubs and eateries, you wouldn't regret your visit to ISKON. This place not just about deities placed in a sanctum. It's quiet a big area to walk around, sit at leisure by the fountain, buy books, shop tiny give-away and not to miss lovely veg food at ''The Higher Taste''.",1
Dear people kind Atten Temple is very good And the timing is very worst and management too ..even not allowing the de...,0
"first impression as soon as i entered this place was that of admiration at the organization part right from the footwear stand to the exit after the round trip. the place is serene, vast and fairly well maintained. Although a temple, its not limited to spirituality in the presence and worship of the idols. There is a well maintained library section, food and beverage section, shopping section with accessories, ethnic wear, wall decor, interior decor, etc etc etc. It even has a restaurant! i had an incredible transition from feeling peaceful and spiritual (in presence of the idols) to being consumer conscious (happens only when shopping) to being enlightened (library) to being satisfied (hunger satisfied at the fnb section). To sum it all up its definitely worth a visit if you keep an open mind and enjoy every change in emotion while soaking in the experience and ambience of this place. Please avoid holidays and weekends, if you are uncomfortable(like me) amongst a crowd. Also, keep in mind, its a very different temple from the usual south indian temples in terms of ambience and spiritual experience.",1
Very spiritual and peaceful place. Generally crowded on special events. This place also has a shopping and food counter.,1
"The temple arrangement is excellent like all ISKCON temples in India and the idol darshan of Lord Krishna with Balaram and Radha is spiritually uplifting. Do try the various prasad offered once you complete the darshan. The restaurant too is good, and offers a good spread of Indian & Chinese dishes.",1
"Nice attraction, lots of food, lots of souvenirs to buy. A well managed crowd. Lots and lots of gold everywhere. Yet, I make no mention of GOD here, you need to get the point by now !",0
Hare Rama hare Rama Hare Krishna Hare Krishna hare hare,1
Temple of dance to the tune of Hare Rama Hare Krishna.. Well maintained temple Very peaceful and Joyful.,1
"Both for a relaxed as well as enjoyable half day, Iskcon temple is ideal .. spacious temple, lot of parking space, chanting all around, excellent prasad and many many food options!! Worth a visit for all in Bangalore.",1
"I came here several times really this is very peaceful place. This time I came with my family. It was Sunday very rushed, we wait long to saw God, but once when we saw we forgot all our tiredness. I feel always to come this place. Hare ram hare ram ram ram hare hare' http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r303062414-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
Awesome Hindu spiritual space with world-class Temple infrastructure,1
"regularly visit with my family for darshans and great vegetarian food with variety of options,especially at the higher taste restaurant..",1
It is one of the most sought after place in Bangalore. The premises is clean and aromatic. People need to visit various temples before they reach to the main temple courtyard. The carving and paintings on the wall and roof is mesmerizing. The prasad is also available at the exit. Variety of items are available for sale at the outer courtyard. The temple trust runs akshay patra scheme in which lakhs of people per day being served with jot food.,1
"if you are visiting bangalore as tourist, then keep set aside atleast 2-3 hours to visit ISKCON. This is a very nice place. the temple, cleanliness is ultimate. the temple premises has food court, restaurant, toilets, etc. one can visit this place either in the evening or during noon. they also offer free meals (lunch) http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r267906277-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
"If you are in Bangalore, one of the iconic places is to visit this temple. Being a holy place, it's beautiful to spend few minutes in prayer no matter whatever faith you believe in. It just connects you in prayers and am sure it would reach your respective God that you believe in. My prayers are with the team who runs this temple and keeping the sanctity intact. My prayers and gratitude to them...",1
"Yesterday we visited Iskcon, Bangalore and had nice experience. Last we purchased many food items treating as PRASADAM. But some of them like samosa, breadrolls, cornpuff etc. found to be stale after one hour of purchase. I felt very bad. I request organizers to take care of this and see that it should not be repeated and devotees should not be suffered. Or keep food items afresh for which u r already charging more. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna",0
"Huge temple with the lots of devotees, place is cream and well organized, food is bit costly . Books n also God relat...",1
"very holy & magical place in the heart of Banglore, a bit different ,than other temples I visited, was a bit cowdy during Sunday",1
It is a lovely place and good to see architecture,1
"DO visit this place if you are in Bangalore - besides the religious aspects, the cool & serene environment will calm your mind. Be prepared to walk a fairly long distance !!",1
"Easy access to temple with large area & ample car parking, well maintained and friendly staff, Photography prohibited, Avoid sharing contact numbers",1
One of the best temple visited in recent times and the maintenance is super. Must visit to spend some time for a peace of mind,1
Well maintained spiritual place.,1
Place of peace of mind and real understanding of god?,1
"This ISKCON Temple is located on a small hillock. A massive construction, the temple is a delight for Bhaktas wanting peace and offer their prayers. The entire layout and facilities provided are very convenient to make the devotees feel comfortable. Thee visit to the temple is a must for those visiting Bangalore.",1
"I have been to the temple a couple of times now and I have to say the place is well-managed. They have a place where you can buy traditional wear (kurtas etc) and other small souvenirs. The food hall is nice and has a wide variety of sweet treats. The only point which concerned me personally was that so many people seem to visit here to simply have the food and spend time on the weekends, hence in my opinion demeaning the importance of the temple worship itself.",0
"The ISKCON Temple in the city of Bangalore is worth a visit for it's uniqueness. Visitors have to pass 2 different deities to pay respect before reaching Lord Krishna's abode at the highest level. Every evening, around 6-7pm, a ceremony is performed, complete with chants to Krishna. Krishna in different forms is in an impressive huge gold pagoda like casing. Attraction is free, but no shoes,sharp objects, camers or bags allowed inside. Good to bring umbrella or raincoat as stairs to temple are in the open air",1
No word... Just love only love this place Jay jaganath,1
"It's a huge beautifully constructed temple , good scenic view as u go on...calm n peaceful atmosphere . Shopping lovers can enjoy the colourful sculpture and and cute Lord Krishna's gift items n and foodies can try different kids of fried items n egg less pastries ... They also play a 20 min animated movie so u can sit bak and enjoy with you kids n have a good day all along",1
We went to ISKCON on july with family. It is a lovely and peaceful place to visit with family. It's some long distance from the city. But it is super place,1
"Good place for family & most important when u listen to the bajan krishna , You can buy any thing with hare krishna on book, CD, carved of krishna. T shirt, kurta, bags (Craft) scented agarbatti all can be purchase. If good place if your foodie. quality of being clean is also ok.",1
Very good experience. Worth a visit irrespective of whether you are a devotee or not. But is highly commercialised and that is a little sad to see.,0
Motichur Laddoos & coconut haligo are good,1
"A magical experience awaits you here. If you are the spiritual kind, come and witness the place that elevates you spiritually. If you get a chance, go for their early morning or the late evening puja which is mesmerizing. Their prashad is divine and the whole experience leaves you ecstatic. Hare Krishna!",1
"Very nice place, every time i visit ...Anybody may spend more than one hour easily. It never makes to feel long as one hour . A wide range of valuable worship items here will make everybody fond of this place.",1
So beautiful temple in Bangluru I like this temple,1
"Exquisite temple for mind healing and spiritual eternity. One will be pleased to see the God standing exemplary with his consorts. Good food in the mall (Yes, Shopping Mall) underground, you can shop for all goodies, books, DVDs and lot more. We enjoyed our time here. I can Easily spend time for even more than 3-4 hours.",1
"Clean, beautiful and peaceful. Deepotsava is held during Diwali.",1
"famous temple for the lord shri krishna. beautiful place with peace, devotion and prayers. the carvings on the walls of temple are gorgeous.",1
"it's good and decent , silent place. better to go with family",1
Soul touching Bajans and pleasant m music during our visit to temple. Free prasad was a bonus with hot kitchidi. I was almost full and could not take free lunch in there Annadan Hall.My family were happy to get God's food. Shall plan my next visit with my old friends and their families. There can be improvement in cooking fresh stock of food in sales counters. Free food is fresh and tastier than sales counters. There is an exception with their higher taste restaurant. They serve Good no of items. But it is not meant for any middle class family.,1
We visited the place for offering puja to Lord Krishna. Being a ISKCON life member I got the opportunity to enter the temple in a special line. Magnificent Temple with huge arrangement for food items. You can have lot of prasadam along with food to eat. Its a life time experience to visit the temple.,1
Great Spread! Tasty and variety. Great snacks like Brinjal Fried and Aloo Tikka. The food quality was very good and the ambience,1
"Clean, organised and beautiful are the words which describe this better. Its a vast temple on a hill with beautiful views inside and outside. Its beauty cannot be explained and has to be seen. Overall worth the time spent there.",1
"Nice place in Bangalore . Its to good to see lord Krishna in temple . There is a shoppes inside to get gifts, good books, sweets , snacks much more and we enjoyed lot in the temple",1
If u ever visit heaven on earth this is it.built over a hill this place is serene calm spiritually great to be here,1
"The temple is definitely of a very good architecture, but the thing is its more trendy and looks like built for commercial purpose. The interior is too good, but we wont get the feeling of worshiping god like any other normal temple. Its located at a very good location and is very easily accessible by public transport.",0
Always love going here. The vicinity of god and the peaceful divine blessing is simply superb. you can be rest assured that you will come back rejuvenating your spiritual self.,1
Mind calming....,1
"I would start by saying it is definitely a place to visit once when you travel to Bangalore. It is well maintained, clean and beautifully constructed in a nice location. Having said that, if you looking for spiritual experience, then you might have to tune your expectations. It is quite commercialized that takes away the spiritual feeling of a temple and becomes more like a picnic spot/mall. It has food court which offers you variety to choose from. Though commercialized, definitely worth visiting once. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r289058095-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",0
Very good environment,1
It is indeed an iconic place to visit while one is in Bangalore. Famous and serene temple to visit with family. Don't forget to visit exhibition area and their famous canteen...they serve some delicious and hygienic snacks and food all made in their own kitchen.,1
A Beautiful place. Very very clean. But somewhat the temple looks like a shopping mall at exit. Well maintained temple,1
"When you visit Iskon, you feel to find new meaning of life, hare Krishna, hare Rama",1
"If you are in Banglore then you should steal some time to visit ISKON temple even if you don't believe in God, it's worth visiting to see it's beauty n neatness, Indian temples should take a lesson from ISKON.",1
"Peaceful place, one can visit it alone or friends or family. Kirtans and Aartis will make you pure and energetic. Must visit place once a week or month",1
"The temple looks completely modern in all kinds, meaning in looks, in cleanness, in worshipping, in organizing, in marketing, in donation collection in everything its ultra modern. Change is the only permanent thing in this world, so we must accept this different kind of approach in temple culture until they are doing good things. When everything is changing with such a fast pace in our life why cant the spirituality also be changed. They have kept all the roots of spirituality intact and modernised only the outer things to please the new generation. Visited January 2014",1
wonderful temple,1
A very beautiful place near Yeswantpur Jn. We got even wonderful ekadashi prasad on ekadashi. Well organised place.,1
Architecture is good. Temple premise is full of devotional flavor. The exit route having too many stalls seem to be a spoil spot though. Had hard time to figure out which restaurant serve nice Satvik buffet meal after darshanam. Prasad queue went little unmanaged despite all efforts by management staff.,1
It's difficult to drive and reach there and find parking but once you reach it's great feeling. You meditate and feel fresh. Temple is situated high for great view once you reach there. Food in Temple is very simple but superb!! One should definitely visit this place,1
Marvelous Krishna temple,1
Jai Shree Krishna,1
"Very Beautiful Temple. Chant God Mahamantra daily: ""Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare"" & be happy",1
"Excellent location must visit. location is very nice, ambiance is quite good, pollution free place, you can enjoy the place with scenic beauty and very well manage automspheair.",1
Good . Very Happy to view and visit this Temple. Worth going here . Ashtami celebration are awesome.,1
"One of the tourist place to visit in heart of Bangalore city. During vacation , we find this place is more crowded.",1
"Golden idols of Lord Krishna, Radha and Balaram are beautiful and main shrine of the temple. Inside the temple you will get in touch with your spiritual self by constant chanting of 'hare rama hare krishna'. Nice place for meditation. Do try eateries available inside temple especially jalebis and bhajias. Prasadam i.e khichdi is ultimate here. Also books on Krishna are well illustrated. Overall a calm and spiritual modern temple.",1
Waiting for my lords birthday.. Preparation is going on grandly though i feel sumthing is missing may b still nt satisfied decorating lords costume becoz everything becomes pale infront of lord krishna n radhe's beauty ....i use to spend day n nite for janmastami's preparation. .....count down begins only 16 days to go..,1
"ISKCON templates around the globe are known for their luxury build and campuses. One in Bangalore is a different level of beauty though. More than a template, it is a perfect place for a half-day (or full-day) family outing. This template offers a large prayer hall, parking facility (valet available), pure veg fine-dine restaurant, pure veg food court, religious and handicrafts shopping and peaceful options to sit around and watch your children play. All this apart from the divine presence of Lord Krishna and the time you spend inside the template hall. Please plan your trip in advance and check the traffic/routes guidance. Metro construction is underway on the Chord Road and traffic jams with up to 30 minutes of delay are very common. Visited November 2013",1
Its a usual temple same as the other part of country. The place is really good and gives you inner peace.,1
"Other than Religious point of you , the temple can be visited to admire the architecture. Just go there and let yourself float in the waves of devotion. Hare raam hare raam, raam raam hare hare Hare krishna hare krishna , krishna krishna hare hare. :)",1
Awesome place for spirituality.,1
"Your soul just calms down as soon as you step in the place, the chanting music, the aroma of incense sticks just wipes off all your stress.",1
"I did the mistake of taking some of my expat friends there as they had heard about it and wanted to see it. From the time we stepped in to the time we left, there were various people who approached them for donations. They were also forced to go through the process of climbing the steps, chanting etc which they were very uncomfortable with. Things are sold everywhere, even inside the temple where the deity is placed. It seems to be very commercially oriented and there was no feeling of holiness or anything at all when I was there with my friends.",0
"I was present for the evening aarti and trust me, it is so peaceful and refreshing. The atmosphere created around you is fantastic. A must visit if you are in Bangalore.",1
The temple is a neat and clean place with plenty of place around where you need to walk uphill and on return walk through various displays of temple merchandises and soveniors. visit to the Isckon managed temple is definitely a pleasant experiance,1
Blessed. Divine experience. Everyone should visit,1
You can check out the timings of the puja on their website. We had targeted between 12.30 pm and 1 pm to beat the rush hour and was able to offer puja as well as see the afternoon arti without hassle.,1
I like this all Mahavishnu photos and prayer.,1
"Lots of walking, but worth the effort. Beautiful temple, each step is a discovery, suggest you try the food at the local restaurant there quite different, also there is a sort of a food open house area, which is quite awesome and the Rasgulla's are delicious.",1
A temple par excellence. a quiet sojourn an ambience befitting a meditative mode.charming atmosphere. A devout can enjoy the solitude of silence and pray to hearts content.,1
"First of all, photography (whether you use a camera or phone) is not allowed inside. Backpacks or big bags are also not allowed. Footwear is not allowed. Sleeveless tops are not allowed. So at the entrance, you'll have to deposit everything not allowed and they will give you claim stubs for them. Entrance to the temple is free but they also have a ""special entry pass"" for 300INR. Not sure if that was only because it was Independence Day (August 15) or if they always have that. Anyway, what's good about the pass, especially if you're a tourist in a hurry, is you get to bypass the queue of devotees. When we were there, it was full house so the special entry pass gave us our space and we got to walk according to our pace. I hope that made sense. Anyway, since it was a real temple of worship we participated in the ritual with much respect. It was a unique and wonderful experience for us. If you're a bit of a clean freak like me, don't forget to bring wet wipes for your feet afterwards.",1
"One of the first things that you notice about the temple is its maintenance which is definitely a plus. The architecture of the temple is also very beautiful. Once you enter the main shrine (Lord Krishna), the aura is simply amazing. However, the stalls and the staffs who sell these items rob us of the ""authentic temple visit experience"" and makes it feel like a bazaar.",1
"Temple is very good. But after darshan temple feels like vv puram chat street. Everything is business... Even though this place is huge, there is no place to relax.",0
This is a very beautiful temple. Being very busy its still pretty organised and is able to provide you a sense of peace and wonderment. There are different ways you can offer puja and also join the arati if you want. Its really a must visit in bangalore. Mind you take a lot of time in hand when you visit. This is in Yeswanthpur and could be a long drive if you are not nearby. Also the car will be parked in one place and you will emerge from somewhere else so pls work that out first.,1
hare Krishna prabhu Krishna is lord God,0
It's very good and famous lord Krishna temple,1
"besutiful and well designed, the ISKCON temple promises a mystifying experience to the visitor. The evening pooja completely captivates each and every person in the main hall and the synergy of the devotees resonates through the atmosphere. The dinner served is of immaculate quality and hygiene. GO even if you are an atheist.",0
"Yes the place is tagged to be spiritual like a temple but too much commercial spin-ups inside waiting for your money to change hands on eatables, offerings, special entries, VIP offerings based on your financial status.",1
"Usually very crowded, but it has been maintained clean and tidy. The prasadam I have heard is a hit or miss. But I personally have never had a bad experience.",1
Very nice and well maintained temple. A must visit temple in bengaluru. Aarti in evening is mesmerizing.,1
"There is something unique about ISKON temples, whether you are in Mumbai or Chennai, you fell in love with vibrant positive energy, Krishna chanting or whole atmosphere. You want to be there and spend a long time, just be closer to Krishna. A great holy place, a must visit.",1
"one of the beautiful temple in bangalore, its just like heaven inside the temple everyone chanting mantras of lord krishna and i loved the visit.",1
The temple didn't give that temple feel. It was like an art emporium. We might call this as a modern temple.,0
Early morning visiting ISKON temple made our day so spiritual. Nice and well organized temple.have divine shopping facilities too.,1
"Home sweet Home.. ""Heaven on Earth"" ISKCON bangalore has transformed my life in a very significant way and I feel very fortunate to have connected to this Heaven. * I see the most glorified souls who is always ready in uplifting others in this temple. * I see there is always a reason to smile and spreading the Love when I'm in the temple. * I see the wonderful divine activities which the temple is initiating and distributing it freely to Everyone. * I have no where seen how beautiful God can be untill I saw the beautiful Dive form of the lord in Iskcon temple Sri Sri Radha Krishna Chandra.. And all other deities in the temple. * The most palatable Pradadam (food) I have ever known and tasted is being served here. * Thanks to Folk Bangalore and All my Folk Friends. (Friends of Lord Krishna) Above all Iskcon Bangalore has shown me how to live a Happy life not just for this life but for Ever! And Ever.. All glories to His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada. ..I Love Iskcon Temple..",1
I recommend this place to Every person....the joy and peace get here is not available any where..from small children to adults.all love this place ance they visit here...,1
"Good place to visit. You get nice, eggless and variety prasadams. A good place to mediate and experience the solace",1
"ISKCON Temples across the country are renowned for their awe inspiring beauty and this one at Bangalore is no different. A bit difficult to access for the senior citizens due to its many stairs and steep climb. But once you are at the top, the beauty of the place just sways you away. Wonderful place for religious people and for all other who desire some time of inner peace, away from the noise of the city.",1
Not much to say about this place. Long Q for getting into the temple. I thought it is more of business in nature over here,0
"This is one of the attraction in Bangalore, that is popular. It's a mix of Old & new. The temple is constructed with sincere approach to make Devine Hindu place of worship, with good facilities to for the visitors. The temple is constructed in small hillock, utilising the hight and space well. You start with Ganesha, in the bottom of the hillock, then few steps up you reach Narasimha, a few steps up you see the Temple of Lord Balaji. Further up on the top of the hill is the temple of Krishna. On the way back, you will see lot of books, all publications of Iskcon, on Geetha and other Hindu religious subjects in different languages. Plenty of sweets and snakes are also available, at a very reasonable prices. There is enough space for car parking. The Iskcon have constructed large marriage hall, that is well maintained. Over all the place is well maintained and good place to visit. Visited July 2014",1
"Bangalore ISKCON temple is a must visit temple in the city. The interior and exterior of the temple is simply superb. U will love to hear the sound of ""HARE RAMA HARE RAMA, RAMA RAMA HARE HARE, HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA, KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE"". Prasadam is too tasty ??. We can BHAGAVADGEETHA books in all the languages at good price.",1
"This is very nice place, very well maintained and organised, good and spacious temple. Very nice place to relax and lose yourself in the devotion.",1
"This was the first destination taken up by our bangaluru darshan bus booked via seabird. The place is great but inside photograhy is not allowed though it offers enough scope from outside. You can sit in the main hall which is all laminated with golden metal from inside. Lots of spiritual books, calander, diaries and toys for children can be purchased. A must visit point in banagaluru.",1
went on an invited session for our wedding anniversary lovely bajans and great prasad afterwards made from shudh desi ghee and pure vegitarian,1
Good,1
Good temple.. Hare Rama Hare Kishna. Krishna krishna hare hare,1
Very good and sacred place all must visits here,1

Nice and pleasant place in Bangalore with nice places to see around,1
God is great,1
"ISKCON temple is located on top of a hillock closer to Rajajinagar first Block and Orion Mall. Entire experience of visiting this temple is so serene and soothing that one is tempted to spend few hours here . On the specific festive days the temple is visited by large no of devotees but the crowd management is perfect . On the days when there are fewer people the experience is still better . Sanctum sanatorium is just breathtaking with the statues of lord Krishna and Radha , chanting of mantras and overall architecture of the temple . Even if one is not very religiously inclined , visiting here will give very positive energy . The complex has good parking arrangements and has several food stalls and a restaurant . They also sell lot of handicrafts,paintings , books etc mostly around Lord Krishna and other religious themes . Overall something unique and worth visiting .",1
one must visit temple of lord krishna and also buy bhagawat gita at discounted rate & take blessings from lord krishna.,1
Amongst one of the must go places to Bangalore. Dont miss it. It is well connected with metro as well.,1
"I had an assumption that it's a commercial kind of temple. After visiting this temple, I changed my view. Nice place....",1
"Pray, Peace, Enjoy, Eat, Shop and Feel the Difference of this Place, The Aroma of Flowers , The Aroma of Sandal Makes you Feel Cool",1
Nice... Calm and peaceful place.,1
I have visited to iskon temple with my family and friends the temple is very a atractive and peace full of mind,1
"Hare Krishna Well maintained, peaceful atmosphere and politely wished by devotees Jai sriparbhupada",1
Very good place,1
Jai shree Krishna,1
Only minus is at times you get a doubt whether it's a temple or shopping complex. too much of shopping stalls.,1
"My friend from the UK and I visited this marvelous temple ( it was one of the attractions - a must visit in his itinerary) earlier this month. He was so impressed with whatever he saw! He was just bowled over!! The Prasadam - he couldn't enjoy as it slipped out of his hand as he couldn't eat with hands!! No spoons!! He was not complaining!! We didn't find any easy exit- we had to go through the entire length of the pathway! Or was there Any easy exist, we wouldn't know! All in all it's a wonderful experience!",1
Nice place in Bangalore to visit for a days time. and it adds value if climate is very good. Nicely managed. No one,1
Lord Krishna is great.he lives in mathura,1
"We were there for chanting and prayers which I found to be quite an emotional experience. It is a large temple with lots of people, and there is an element of commercialism at the temple with the shops. However, considering the free lunches and support the temple gives to the local communities, this is understandable. Very glad we visited the temple. A great experience!",1
More than divinity it looks like a shooping centre..,0
"Though its temple, I could see lot of people visit as a sight seeing. Nice place. A good built in peaceful atmosphere.",1
This place gives peace of mind.,1
"Beautifully done. Exquisite idols of Lord Krishna, Breathtaking view from the hill on which this is situated. Very visitor friendly and very easy for differently enabled people to visit. Very clean and well managed. Wish all important temples were so serene and well managed inspite of so many devotees visiting daily. A must visit in Bangalore",1
"The enormous temple where marble use is liberal, is among the best ISKCON temples in the world. Try to take in an ""Aarti"" - it is amazing to see how many faiths have united to worship the Hindu god Krishna.",1
"In recent years, I have turned down the temple visits, just because when they get crowded, it is very suffocating ... and all the religious sentiments go for toss ... the mental peace for which one goes to temple is lost. This ISKON is different. a) there is lot of open space; b) the main temple has high ceiling giving a lot of breathing space - even when it is crowded to peak; c) the live chants (not the recorded CDs) make it very divine, beautiful and soothing. One feels good after visiting this temple. Added on advantage is the food court - very good. For those who are little more practical like me, a lot of parking space too ...",1
"Although outside the city but worth visiting it. Went with family and they found it the best place among all I showed them. Construction is excellent, very clean place and very quiet as well. We bought a special ticket for 100 per head so we were allowed to pay visit to all temples without any queue.",1
"Really beautiful, nice area around the temple as well. People are very considerate. Breath taking during festival time. Very approachable, really worth the trip for both devotees and tourists.",1
very good experience of going to iskon temple with friends and its a place where we can be calm and have good peace of mind and very good place to worship.it is very good place,1
As the title say Serene and Divine place to visit. A must visit place for ISCON followers as well as for the first timers. Surely one of the top places to visit while in Bangalore. If time permits do try for morning darshan and the view from top of temple is not to be missed. Only one turn off: There is a high sense commercialization at the Exit gates. which makes this destination a typical tourist spots.,1
Loved it,1
Very cleanly atmosphere Very good place for meditation Best maintained,1
Awesome Decor and spiritual place to visit. Great experience.,1
Hare Krishna,1
Visit in Iskcon temple is amazing experience of my life. It is beautiful and well maintained and crowd is more there,1
"Its a beautiful temple....one of the biggest and most royal temples in the world....you will feel great....if you are pressed for time, please do not go thru the chanting line as it takes a long time...go on a empty stomach...because the free prasad is lip smacking....and also there is a huge spread of food stuff at the end of the temple....you get great foods here....cannot believe such a large variety of food in a temple...enjoy....",1
Must visit place if you are in Bangalore. Ambiance is electric and contagious specially when rendering of kiratns happen,1
"Very well organised, trouble free darshan, Gifts shops are abundant with religious gifts & books. Prasadam stalls are filled with mouth watering varieties...",1
It was a wonderful feeling to b in that atmosphere.,1
"Exquisite temple at Hare Krishna hill on Chord road, it's pure bliss as one enters the sanctum sanatorium to behold Sri Radharani and Sri Krishna idols who are very intricately decorated with minute attention to details. Add to it the chants of Lord's glory echoing through the huge hall having beautiful murals depicting the pass times of Krishna. Seems as if it's real or everything is a passing dream not to be woken up. Pure bliss. One can buy the special darshan tickets for group of 4 or 6 person, which entitles speedy darshan including at Narasimha, Balaji and finally the Radha Krishna along with Nitai Gauranga and Krishna Balarama in main temple, by passing the queues. This pass also gives privilege to offer prayers (archana) and take prasads and books. However I would recommend going in normal queue, which gives the privilege of chanting ""Hare Krishna"" mantra 108 times with other devotees as one climbs to the temple. Everyone is served a bowl of prasad at the exit and on Sundays it's lunch (satvik and tasty). However there are many snack items available just before the exit one can buy, like samosa, kachori, rasagola, gulab jamuns, pizza slices, burgers, sandwiches, juice. Souvenir shops aplenty to satiate your yearnings to keep memories of visiting ISKON at Bangalore. Timings: Monday through Friday 4:15am - 5:00am 7:15am - 1:00pm & 4:15 - 8:20pm Saturday, Sunday and public holidays, 4:15am - 5:00am 7:15am - 8:30pm Ample space for parking and keeping shows at lockers. Toilets are nearby to these lockers. Servitors are friendly and ever helpful in assisting devotees.",1
It was good once we entered the temple. We went by cab and it took us 1.5 hr and total 3 hrs travelling to return back to the hotel.,1
The temple is very beautiful and clean. Proper way of entering and exit. Good prasadam. Snacks also available inside.,1
"Hello guys , Iskcon its giving daily to devotees for Darshan. Iskcon includes all gods in one place and also their selling devotional books, photos and many more. Iskcon timings for Darshan 4.15 am to 8.15 pm. So kindly visit the before timings. Iskcon group is helping for poor students. And supply food to schools its like Anna dasoha program is organised by iskcon temple.",1
The best iskcon temple of whole world without an iota of doubt.,1
"It's a good place to visit, very clean and well maintained. Also, visit the kitchen, if you could. Get to know how th...",1
"I have been to a couple of ISCKON temples around India and this one tops the list... Its a really beautiful temple near Orion Mall... It is open till 12:30 PM everyday and once again open after 4 PM...You have to walk or climb steps before you reach the main temple.. Go around 12 and there is no queue and you get nice darshan... The main Radha Krishna idol is really great and they decorate it with flowers and the idols clothes are changed everyday... and all of it is really beautiful... With Hare Krishna chants going on continuously, it really feels good..Also, no garlands or coconut can be offered so the temple is really clean... You can sit and keep watching the idols for hours and you will really feel at peace... The best part is the khichadi that they server as prasad... its always piping hot and really tasty.. They give in a leaf bowl and not too much quantity so you dont tend to waste it... Nice temple to go and visit..",1
It's nice inside but people made it a religious (shopping ) mall.,0
When you are bored of bangalore traffic then this would be the place where you can visit and relax your mind for few hours. I am sure you would get energized with the positive vibes in and around the temple.,1
My favorite place in the world.. Awesome by each inch.. :-*,1
Visiting temple was good but the whole complex is highly commercialized. Prices are way too high than the worth of products.,0
"One of the most beautiful places & temple i have ever seen...... Such a wonderful atmosphere..... Every one should visit it atleast once, even non-believers to experience the architecture.....",1
"A very good temple in the middle of Bangalore, very nicely maintained and organised. there might be a little rush during festivals. Very close to the Metro station.",1
the one of the IsKcon temple with an fine dine the temple has a well maintained Ambiance & cleanness is taken as top priority you can select the food you like at the end o the darshan as variety of food is kept for sale as prasadams the temple is a heaven for love birds who want to spend some...,1
Its good to visit the temple once and go in general Que with mantra jaap of 108 times. Sometimes gives you a feel of shopping malls . Atmosphere is really very peaceful and calm.,1
it is not less than a shopping mall.. pure business center.. no doubt it has good architecture and views..,0
Very well managed and beautiful place. Evening aarti is excellent. Try reaching by 7 pm and stay there till Aarti and Palaki utsav is complete. You can have good food in the Temple canteen also.,1
"Beautiful temple, stucked in a corner in Benguluru. Loved the Prasadam there. Must visit for those tarvelling to Bengluru",1
"This temple is built on a hill in Rajajinagar. It is nice to visit once , however on the way out we have to pass through numerous shops selling ISKCON merchandise and food items. This makes it seem very business like instead of a temple. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r271055165-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",0
"This temple provides peace of mind. There are 3 levels to reach the main temple. There are proper queue and enough space. Attending aarti in the evening is loud but provides peace of mind. The parking may not be enough on festive days. After the main temple there are array of shops selling soveniers and food items. Guess, they could have provided place to sit and eat. Therefore people sit on floor and results in unclean floors, especially with food stuff. You can also relax outside the main temple in the premises. It is definitely peace of mind place.",1
"The temple inside is interesting but to get out is a maze of shops and all of them carry the same items. By the 5 or 6th time you've seen something, you're likely to give in.",0
"Excellent veg Buffet.Not many place in Bangalore offer fine dining.While not exactly fine dining,it's almost there.The menu is thoughtful.All kind of veg starters , different types of rice,NIndian and SIndian,noodles.A bit of everything.A little bit of a mish mash but tasty nevertheless.Attention to detail is refreshing.Dessert could have been more imaginative.Pastry and usual range of Indian sweets.All in all pretty satisfying.The decor and presentation could be fine tuned.For Veg buffet is Rs 500 odd too much to pay?Conflicting opinions within our group regarding this Madhavan Nair",1
Amazing temple. Plus the food.,1
this is a awesome place in Bangalore. more over the top location this very nice and out-side seen around the temple is nice.,1
We had taken our family members who were visiting from London and they along with us were definetly floored with the temple. This is a modern temple and one can get lots of positive vibes on entering the main hall. We sat in the hall for some time and left with a peaceful mind. Will keep on visiting regularly,1
"""The discipline, cleanliness and the ambiance is very well maintained here.""",1
"Feeding thousands of devotees everyday irrespective of race, religion or creed. Selfless Service!",1
Beautiful and peaceful place. However here if you have money or you donate something then they will give more attention to you.,0
"One of the biggest temple of Krisha in India. Very much clean, Enough guards & self service men supporting devotees. Good 'Prasad'. Very good architecture & structure.",1
"After a long bumper to bumper drive from cantonment, reached this temple after about 45 mns. One of the first few to arrive for dinner, found the menu very fascinating with a interesting mixture of purely vegetarian food from various parts of India, predominantly S Indian. Service was prompt but staff were not trained and could not properly explain menu items. Found the food to be very oily and loaded with salt. Price was reasonable but fell short of expectation as the quality was not upto the mark.",0
Shree Krishna Temple created and managed by ISKCON group. Very peaceful and devotional place. While returning from main temple you may fell you are in a plaza. As they make you to go through small market.,1
"Visiting Iskcon temple in Bangalore is an experience by itself. The God almighty Shri Krishna is on the top of a small hillock in Malleswaram area in Bangalore. From the main road, you can either drive down or walk up. To enjoy the scenario, I recommend walking up. In the steps up, you can have the darshan of Lord.Ganesha, Lord Narasimha , Lord Hanuman and Lord Balaji. Once you enter the main Lord Krishna hall, you really feel the vibe rations, your concentration increases and you are into different world. In spite of the big crowed the place is kept very clean. On the way, we see lot of shops, where you can buy varieties of hand craft gift items. Some times you feel that the temple have become a shopping complex! In a country like India you cannot help it, as it becomes very unviable to keep such open space empty.",1
"The place is clean, organised, nice architecture...but as you enter first of all you are supposed to cover your exposed body (sleeveless, knee pants, shorts etc. not allowed) so they actually cover you with a scarf or lend you a long skirt (for women, I don't know about men). Inside there are guards who will ask couples to sit apart and not face each other/ hold hands etc. Once you exit, the exit path is compulsorily through the commercial market/ complex which is just never-ending. Only after finishing your tour through the marketplace (right beneath the temple premises), you reach the prasad that is the famous ISKCON khichadi (that is the only nice part). Even if you are impressed by the temple n all, the market is a huge put off and spoils the mood instantly. This is the only ISKCON I have seen which has a such a huge market area. Delhi & Bombay have a smaller one, but it is all the same way of exiting through the market to make you tempt and buy something in the name of God! Sigh!",0
Amazing Temple. One of the best in India..,1
"This place is so awesome, that it can't be described in words.",1
"It's a wonderful spiritual place..good architecture,inside the temple you will get spiritual books ??, dress ??, different types of food ??,.. At the exit point temple provide khichrdi,which is delicious.. A way of saying modernization of Indian temples, But together with the modernization also came commercialization. eg:- there were food stalls selling food(puffs, sweets,rolls) inside temple before they actually gave...",1
"Very nicely designed and maintained temple, evenings are awesome. Their hararhis are must see, reach 30 mins before so that you will reach inside on time",1
A corporate temple. Excellent.,0
Very good place to spend time peacefully with continuous Hare Krishna Chanting.,1
It's a big and beautiful temple located on a small hill. One should visit it if in Bangalore. The food here is satvik and the Higher Taste restaurant is a must to try when in the campus.,1
This is a amezing place radhe krishna,0
Amazing place,1
Fantastic place...,1
Must visit.. Try the vip route if short of time.,1
"First of all, one must know what ISKCON stand for - ""International Society for Krishna Consciousness"" and I greatly thank ISKCON for this great movement of spreading consciousness, vedic knowledge and the message of Lord Krishna all over the world. ISKCON Bangalore is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world and is also one of the most popular religious site. The overall structure of the temple is spectacular, the surrounding area is clean and well maintained and of course the environment inside is very peaceful. I like the way you get Darshan in a very systematic and disciplined manner even when its too crowded, though if possible I prefer early morning hours(7-8 AM) to take Darshan of Lord Krishna since that's the freshest time of the day and also less crowded. At the end of Darshan, temple serves free khichadi Prasadam to all visitors. A needy can get a free lunch too - the facility provided by ISKCON which is really appreciable.",1
A divinely maintained temple .....really nice,1
Iskcon is a huge temple of Lord Krishna and it has a beautifully blissful main sannidhi to which you've to go to chanting hare rama Hare Krishna on each of the 108 steps before the sannidhi. It is absolutely amazing if u sit there for evening aarti. There are shops here and many things have become commercialised. Wear salwar preferably. Leave your footwear in the car itself. There are two hotels in the property.,1
I visit this place usually.. I feel relaxed and calm. the main attraction here is temple architecture and roof top design and sclupture of sri radha and krishna bhagwan.. one cannot take their eyes from the beauty of sri krishna..... I would strogly recommend this place.,1
Superb place#good architecture #so much coolness#,1
"Its the only iskcon temple in Bangalore, around at rajajinagar. Best way to visit all the famous places in Bangalore is to buy Bangalore darshini ticket (its a hop on hop off bus service) which offers an entire day travel, plus has a guide who tells u more on history & stories related to all these places & its a cheaper & convenient option as a lot of places within Bangalore are quite far off distance & traffic is a buzz kill too. I used to visit iskcon temple mainly over the my free weekends when i wanted some peace & tranquility from everyone & everything around me.",1
Quite a structure and an experience to visit. The constant request for money became a little irritating. Very commercialised. Definitely worth paying the extra to take the fast track and avoid the queues. You need to dress conservatively or you won't get in or will be asked to wear a wrap provided at a cost.,0
"It's good place everyone who are devotees It's full of divine atmosphere chanting Hare krishna mantra while entering Visit once ,then will like it",1
"Ideal spot for spending some moments in Krishna devotion. Well connected, well planned & well managed with parking lo?",1
"Every time remember krishna, that heart is pureness&peaceful.srila prabhupadar is pure devotee of krishna?",1
"A thoroughly insightful experience. Incredibly interesting from the very first steps. Would not hesitate to recommend anyone visiting this temple during their travels, as you will absolutely not regret it. I know traveling around India can sometimes mean going to a lot of temples, but I would encourage everyone to experience this one in particular. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r284223841-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1

Awesome Hindu temple,1
"very well maintained temple, there is a lot of divinity the way the Poojas are held, the Prasadam they offer is also very tasty. Have a lot of souvenir shops at the ground level and lot of eateries also. A must see place while in Bangalore?",1
"The temple is well organized from parking, shoe racks to q-line. With rupees 300 ticket, you can watch the idols a bit closer and get the Pooja/archana done. One is forced to walk pass through the stalls, mostly food items. Feels more like a commercial place",0
A wonderful temple where people move around in discipline. The monks are very polite.There is ample space. It is in the heart still away from the crowd. This temple is included in Bengaluru Darshan.,1
A temple which is like desire tree...... Hari bol..,1
"This temple is the best place to relax your mind, the main temple is so peaceful with chanting of Hare Krishna !! Hare Krishna !! Krishna Krishna Hare Hare !! .. The bhajans are so devotional , poojas/aarathis are great. You get positive vibes while chanting in the main hall. A must visit place in Bangalore. At the time of krishnastami the place is really good and packed with devotees with lots of chanting s. Its clean and well maintained/organized. Do visit.",1
"this temple has produced some kind of awareness in people ,but now its turning out 2 be a commercial place",0
"A very well maintained, neat and clean temple dedicated to Lord Krishna. ISKON Temple is located on a hillock in Rajajinagar, Bangalore. The view of the surroundings from the temple is awesome. The security checks, railings for the separation of the queue, the shoe stands and everything else in the temple is very well organised. We had been to the temple in evening and participated in the evening arati. It was great experience of people singing and dancing chanting ""Hare Krishna Hare Rama"". The temple really offers an atmosphere of peace and purity. It was an altogether very soothing experience for me. It's a must visit place for people of all age groups.",1
It is a good place to visit but everything is too commercial.,0
"A bit of a trek but if you are in Bandra, then you wont have a problem getting here. Temple is closed from 1-4 so dont go then, although there is a free lunch outside near the shoes deposit. Take your shoes off and go for a walk. They have chanting and meetings in the evening or before 1. You can have a wedding or stay in the hotel here. All the food is veg and is made in the kitchen near the back There is always somebody around who will take you around and give you some history, he will usually ask for a donation and give you some books. There is also a buffet at lunch for 400rs. Worth it!",1
"A big shopping complex that is cashing on the brand ""krishna"", not a temple",0
Usually visit iskcon on regular basis.no hassles for parking and all thing are monitored in a very proper manner.recommend all to visit once when you are in Bangalore.,1
temple is very peaceful and pleasant,1
"As soon as i entered from the gate i could smell the flowers,hear the murmurs of students wearing white sarees.While,all the time i was under the impression that the temple would be filled with statues of gods and goddesses or filled with Lord Krishna's idols,books n stuffs etc.however,to my pleasant surprise this place was infact an institution,with varieties of fun...",1
"One visit to this temple will for sure ensure that no more u will ever have an iota of doubt whether God exists r not.whether it's the ambience r decorations of God's,Puja,Prasad,clean lines will make one feel so relaxed and soothing.

"The Iskcon temple is located on top of a hill in Bangalore. The views are good and the temple is quite serene. Like all famous temples, the queue to get in is predictably very long. Visited here 2 yrs ago",1
This place I feel is almost a must visit in Bangalore. It is an altogether a different and a good experience even if you an not really a follower of God.,1
"I personally feel Iskcon temple has been commercialized. At every nook and corner, you can find people selling some or the other stuff. It is a majestic place. Good for walking and shopping. But if you want peace of mind and be with lord Krishna, I would not suggest this place.",0
Must visit place for all visitors of Bangalore. No restrictions for based on religion or culture. Anybody can visit and pray to the GOD. Wonderful Architecture and well maintained.,1
This is best place to visit in Evening. they organized very well and they have a restaurant inside the temple which offers satvik food at unbelievable rates.,1
"To my mind Iskcon Temple Bangalore is one of the best Hare Rama Hare Krishna Temple which I have visited. Lord Krishna is same every where but when I say excellent means decor of temple, infrastructure, cleanliness, temple staff behavior, discipline, security etc. So far I have visited Iskcon Vrindavan, Delhi, Mumbai, Kanpur, Haridwar & Bangalore. I found Bangalore is more organised. Others to learn.",1
Good temple to visit. Please note they dont allow shorts and western dresses. Also they dont allow cameras inside mandir complex,1
"You would feel religious at time of entry if you had visited ISKCON before, however the whole experience is a facade with a lot of shopping articles and food court.",0
Wonderful trip to meet Lord Krishna . Godly presence of dear Radha and Krishna is joyous harmony and union,1
"A class apart....this place offers such a peaceful atmosphere that you just immerse urself in deep introspection.....the systemic management, cleanliness, breakfast counter, shoe counter....everything in a proper order makes it a nyc place to visit and enjoy...the architectural marvel stands tall among the tall buildings of the silicon valley of India.....",1

Drinking water is always made available. Wash rooms are well maintained. Even physically challenged persons can visit. Wheel chairs are available. Personal cars can go to the top spot. Plenty of food items are sold. Rates are marginally higher than the market prices. Children can play and enjoy. Lot of music and chanting will make you pleasant. I do not advocate to buy lot of displayed articles because others are buying. Bus convenience, Metro convenience is available. Security is alert and check thoroughly. Men and women security is available. Volunteers are also involved in serving the visitors. Every one irrespective of age can enjoy the visit.",1

The ISKON temple in Bangalore is one of the better temples in South India dedicated to Lord Krishna. Being a Life Member you have a direct access without having to wait in the long queues at this magnificent temple for the Lord . The devotees at ISKON run the temple on a volunteer basis and very often people who have been in important positions and jobs have given up their material life to devote themselves to be volunteers in this organization. Their free food Scheme called Akshayapatra delivers thousands of meals to needy children across different parts of Bangalore all managed by the devotees making it one of the biggest such endeavors in the world as it is run for 365 days a year without any break.,1
"You can reach temple by Metro train or bus or by auto from Bangalore. Easily accessible. Temple is on hill, hence need to climb if on walk. Or else auto /car can drop at entrance in side temple. Take 300 rs ticket for entire family. Puja of god takes 10-15 minutes. Have sumptuous food in canteen before prasad,. Wide variety of foods available. Food will be enjoyed by kids.",1
"this is a temple deicated to lord krishna, it is a huge structure . it has a very efficient visitor management system. it offers a sumptous prasadam which is made in a hygenic manner.",1
Peace of mind and beautiful decoration.,1
"HARE RAMA,. HARE KRISHNA..... Gud place",1
"Good place, well maintenance. But they are restricted exits, one have to go through all the shops by queues. Compare ...",1
"If you are in bangalore, plan a visit to iskon temple. Well maintained, neat and clean. Beautiful architecture and a great feeling when you are inside the main temple.",1
"It is a peaceful and very clean temple one would see in India. The approach to the main temple is well organized with separate paths for up and down as the temple is located on a small hill top except at few areas where the path is too narrow and may not manage big crowds. On the way to main temple first comes the Srinivasa govinda and then Prahlada narashima sannadhis. The main temple have Srinitai gauranga, Srikrishna balarama and Sriradhakrishna chandra gods. After dharsan one would step down through a large number of stalls including bakeries, which I felt too many in numbers very close to the main temple and looked odd. Then next comes prasada (annadhanam) distribution. After which one can climb down to the temple exit. At least one hour or more than two hours in case of elders is required to cover this temple.",1
The most beautiful temple of Bangalore and so Much big area. You can get to see Lord Krishna with all the gold in full. Also lord Krishna every thing about childhood days. Also the prasadam was too much good for taste. Inside the weather is so much cool. You will feel like you were sourrouded by all the gods.,1
"Such a nice temple, there is lots of things u can c, when ever I come in bangalore at list one time I have to come here",1
Nicr palace to go with family,1
Very cool and calm atmosphere in the temple food is costly in the temple but quality is good.,1
"Although the temple is relatively new, it is still a beautiful place to visit. Although I am not a Hindu, I felt welcomed here. The main temple is beautifully decorated in solid gold. The floors are marble. Because it is a practicing place of worship, you have to take your shoes and socks off to enter. If you are not wearing long pants (for men) you rent a wrap to cover your legs.",1
"Hi friends, This temple has a become more commercial place,than a place of worship,but the temple and the lord krishna in it,is a visual treat for our eyes,for that reason I will visit again?",1
"beautiful temple , excellent management. this is one of the best temple for krishna , good maintanance",1
Great place to visit where one could experience a lot of positive vibes and get to spiritually recharge to endure the daily grind!,1
Built with international standards one can only wonder how smooth can the journey to the Darshan be with pipelines and footwear arrangements . The cleanliness and discipline make you love being there all the more and the live chanting of hare Rama hare Krishna all the way as you go up the 20 minute path is so serene and peaceful....,1
"This place is highly commercialized, so if you are seeking spiritual feel. I am not sure, you will get it here. Still I appreciate the charity works done by Management",1
"The first thing that strikes you is how spotlessly clean this vast complex is. This is despite the heavy crowds that throng this place. A different experience is gained by going at night. Then, the sheer marble shines majestically in the night. Every place is well lit and there are lots of volunteers to assist you. The shrine is filled with chants and hymns. Even if you are not a Krishna devotee, it moves you to see the ardent devotion here. This was truly a beautiful experience.At the end of the tour, we are offered a sweet offering. We can also buy books and other materials. There is a small handicrafts corner. The work there is nothing short of spectacular, and one must really appreciate the fine craftsmanship. However, prices are also quite high, but justifiable.This place is a gem to visit. It is also open to people of all faiths.",1
"Van de tempels die ik bezocht heb was dit verreweg de grootste. Ik was er op goede vrijdag, een vrije dag in India en de belangstelling was overweldigend. Met zijn vieren konden we voor 1000 roepies een VIP pas kopen. Daarmee heb je met maximaal 6 personen toegang tot de hele tempel en word je om de rijen heen geleid. En rijen waren er. Na twee kleinere tempels kom je terecht in wat ik de hoofdtempel zou noemen. Wie in de rij gestaan heeft is nu eindelijk bij zijn doel aangekomen. Wij werden verwezen naar een wachtruimte en verzocht te gaan zitten. Uiteindelijk stonden we vlak voor het altaar. Priesters voerden daar een ritueel op en daarna kregen we een bloem voor achter het oor. Ondanks dat ik weinig van de religie weet een indrukwekkende ervaring. Minder vond ik wat daarna kwam. Niet de uitleg van wat Hare Krishna nu inhoudt, maar wel de enorme hoeveelheid stands met Merchandise. Menig professionele voetbalclub zou er wat van kunnen leren. Zelf ben ik nog opgevoed met het beeld van Jezus die de handelaren de tempel uit sloeg... De opbrengst schijnt wel naar een goed doel te gaan. Maar de ""gemiddeld"" is er een uitvloeisel van. Al met al toch wel een spirituele ervaring. Wel was ik blij met het advies van onze chauffeur om de schoenen vast in de auto te laten. Voor mijn gevoel scheelde dat een hoop gedoe na afloop.",0
This temple is situated at a height and a place for really a great view of Bangalore. Temple ambience is really great like other ISKCON temples and the same with Lord Krishna Idol. Eateries at end are also mouth watering and in well hygienic conditions.,1
"Its a place to get good spiritual experience. Normally ISKCON is known for its Akshaya Patra program. Where thousands of School Children are fed. They have a very big automised kitchen which is very clean and hygenic. Temple Complex is quite huge. What we liked more is the Abhisheka Seva on every Friday for Lord Srinivasa and every Saturday for Prahallad Nrisimha. It happens around 05.20 am and lasts for 20-25 minutes. Its a paid Seva limited to 5-6 couples and their family of 4 members. As it is performed very early in the morning members can book accommodation at the Guest House at a reasonable rate. GH is very spacious and can accommodate 6 members in bigger rooms. We have 2 and 3 bed rooms also, We have participated in this Seva on 4 occasions. The main event days are -- Annual Brahmotsava, Vaikunta Ekadashi and Kartik Deepotsava.",1
u need u develop more buy keeping updates day to day,0
"As the Name Dervices more than I type here, Its the Place of Lord Krishna, Popularly known as Hare Krishna Hills, A Must visit for everyone, they give kichadi yummy and tasty as prasadam, over and above if you are fooddy you can eat a lot....",1
"So many things to do at ISKCON. Pray, meditate, sing, participate in chanting, great food corner, books and other interesting gift ideas. The idols just speak to you !! A must visit place if you are in Bangalore !",1
LORD KRISHNA AND OTHERS TEMPLES ALSO ITS BEATYFULL PLACE IN ISKCON TEMPLE,1
"I have been to Iskon temple last week. I went to there at 7 AM. Atmosphere is too good and I had the best shot of sun rising. Staying in the guest house is a wonderful memory. Rooms are too small but enough for two people to accomdate. AC, heater, Cleanliness all facilities are good. I had the Krishna prasadam, but didn't know that I have to wash my own plate with soap and water ( neither any one mention in the reviews too) There is a restaurant nearby but missed the food there. Will try next time for sure. As one of the review said it's a commercial place I agree with it. Inside the temple it's like a super market, you get every thing. Overall a very memorable visit in Bengaluru",1
When you visit BANGALORE you can visit this place. Connected to the city center by METRO SERVICE. preferably travel by metro to save time due to heavy traffic. approachable from AIR PORT BY road.,1
The ambience of the huge temple makes one feel divine and the chores make you feel devoted to Lord krishna. Praying redefined!,1
systematic treatment.....so that believers can totally indulge into their worship.....clean and beautiful place.,1
Veryyy niceee templeee........i reallyyy likee.....enjoy so muchh.....jai shri radhe,1
We went on a weekend around 1030 so the place wasn't crowded. Its a good spiritual place and we finished the entire visit in an hour. We also had some mini breakfast here ( the food court is awesome ). But did not like the shops inside the temple. The temple staff are very cordial but do take care if you with kids. We saw many parents who were asked to control their kids . Kids running around and making noise is a complete NO here. With the metro and a nearby flat being constructed the calmness is dipping day by day.,1
"Should you be interested in Krishna don't miss this world's biggest Hare Krishna Temple. A very clean, bright and inspiring place for Puja and Prayers.",1
its awesome place please visit once. Temple staffs and members are too much supportive,1
Well maintained parking !! A peaceful temple! Cab and buS availability is excellent!,1
"Marvelous temple, nice view of the southern bangalore",1
"I remember visiting it during my college days in 2002 at that time it was really nice and focused only on prayers and other activities, but this time I see lot of shops selling their merchandise (ISKCON) stuffs... Not really impressed by the way it has evolved. I feel like it has became a local attraction more than a temple",1
One of the recent inclusions to our Bangalore fity is this temple. Very well maintained with its sarine atmoshere. A temple of class to the mass. Hygeni is well maintained inside the temple and also outside including in the restaurants.,1
"Great view, infrastrature is superb...feel walm n calm to stay",1
"Beautiful temple in Bangalore. Bhajans, Arati and main deities are spectacular. No words to descibe the beauty. You will get various prasadams underground.",1
Peaceful and clean Temple complex. Elders have to take into account of climbing lots of stairs. Might become tiresome...,1
Excellent temple in Bangalore . Nice view of hill area to seen city.. good place to get peace. Hare Krishna hare ram,1
"Iskon Temple have number of pujaris who worship the dieties according to vaishnava tradition. Iskon is popular by the name of Sri Sri Radha Parthasarathi Mandir devoted to Lord Krishna and Radharani.The museum inside the mandir is well equipped with complex modern technologhy spreading knowledge about vedic culture.The temple echoes the chanting of maha mantra ""Hare Ram, hare ram. ram ram,hare hare, Hare krishna ,hare krishna .Krishna krishna,hare hare "" leaving one mind,body and soul pure and tranquil.its a beautiful temple and a must see in the city http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r317321892-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",1
Went there with a friend who wanted to show me around the place. Good and interesting place with calm and serene atmosphere,1
The variety of awesome food was on display. Liked the sitting layout . Taste was great . One can over-eat & not fall sick:) Next to the temple makes you feel good,1
"Bangalore has many old temples. Iskcon is rather new addition in Bangalore. It is a nice, neatly maintained temple complex. All the visitors are given Prasad or offering to Sri Krishna to eat. But, the place is highly commercialized. While exiting the temple, the visitor has to necessarily see all the merchandise of Iskcon available for sale!",0
Nice temple and well connected with public transport. No entry fee and well managed by peoples. proper arrangement for darshan,1
"Iskcon Temple, Bangalore is spread across 7 acres of land and it is the one of largest Iskcon temples in the world.",1
Good atmosphere Temple,1
"those who have seen the Jain temples of India with their impeccably kept manner, their cleanliness, would love the ISKCON premises.Very systemically designed by the best brains of the country they are a welcome site to visit many times over.The fact that they are welcome to people from all religions is a point in their favor unlike certain other temples...a must visit... P.S.they are trail blazers in having a fan following on Facebook twitter etc all",1
"The institution promoted for the cause of bhakti and service stands tall. Iskcon is easily accessibly by rail, metro, buses and taxis. The architecture is beautiful as we can see the sky through them. Once inside the temple you would feel the warmth of God, and breeze of his love. Yes, please chant Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare You will be leaving the temple premises with a lot of vigour and stress free. I suggest all to visit ISKCON Bangalore at least once in a life time",1
Aesthetic and calm. Must visit place in Bangalore. Doesn't matter if you believe in spirituality. Give it a try,1
"It is a landmark in Bangalore , where divine blends with cleaniliness. The deity invites you in three stages , the first stage , Lord Narasimha , the stage Lord Venkateswara ( Vishnu) and the final and uppermost stage of Krisha , with Balarama and with Radha . Peace prevails at the temple and added to that is the Blessings of the Lord Krishna , Balaji & Narasimha . The best part of the temple is you cannot take your eyes of the Lord , so captivating",1
"The entire atmosphere is very enlivening, the kirtans are very estatic, the food very sattvic and tasty, the deities extremely beautiful, a must see place on your nest visit to Bangalore",1
It's a good for beautiful temple in Bangalore,0
A must visit place in Bangalore. Neat and Clean. Nice view of the city as it is built on an elevated place,1
Must visit place for Krishna devotees. Nice big hall and puja area. Tends to get over crowded on weekends and especially Aarti time. Difficult with small kids. Queues are pretty long on sacred days. Food is okay.,1
"Notwithstanding the glamour and opulence displayed, it looked more of a supermarket/exhibition of wares. One of the eatery stalls was selling stale french fries. When I asked him to heat it up, the counter assistant bluntly and rudely refused and said "" Take it or leave it"" in Hindi! I do not think the Holy Founder of Iskon would approve of any of these. This is meant to be a feedback and not a criticism and is also not meant t hurt anyone. All well wishers of Iskon must step up their involvemen",0
The atmosphere and cleaning with details make you feel total fulfilment with peace. The Bhagat Gita works in books and CD were amazing . The Parsad is awesome. You just want to be sitting there for peace. Will like to visit again and again. S K Bhargava,1
"I visited the Sri Radha krishna Temple with my family on Sunday May 25th around 12=30 PM.Temple was heavily crowded,still Car parking was available. It was a beautiful place with garden,Fountains & good View point.Chanting Hare Krishna Hare RAMA we reached a special location where 108 small steps are provided where we can chant 108 times Hare Krishna, Hare Rama.

At the exit hot Pongal prasadam was distributed to all the Visitors . Beautiful place to visit & pray Lord Krishna. Visited May 2014",1
Excellent,1
"It is situated on the small hill and super, spectacular view fromthe top of the hill. From the foot of the hill to the top Sri Krishna temple, one can visit various temples. One should not miss the Maha Aarthi time performed for Sri Krishana in the evening, which is very beautiful.",1
The temple very nice and calm place. You can go there and relax and do meditation. If you are visiting Bangalore and do visit the temple.,1
"Even though the ambiance was nice, hardly felt like visiting a temple, it basically has become a commercial place where they try every possible way to sell their merchandise.",0
"Wonderful place. Ignoring the sellers, best place to worship.",1
"Most attractive deities in a beautiful and serene location, ISKCON temple MUST BE VISITED. DO NOT MISS the food in the attached restaurant. Lot of parkind place and Well maintained rooms for Life members .",1
Bangalore ISKCON temple is one of the best in it's peers. you can visit this place for inner peace. Must Visit!!,1
You get peace as soon as you enter the temple,1

Hari Bol... Hare Krishna..,1
The ISKCON temple in Bangalore is a good tourist attraction. I would recommend it to people who are fit to walk.,1
A temple with some wonderful statues of various Hindu gods. Arouses a divine feeling and serves some tasty and awesome Prasadam. A good place to visit especially in the evenings. An excellent restaurant run by ISKCON rightly called The Higher Taste serves some delicious Satvik food. A must visit place.,1
"Very good place, people who really want to enchant Hare krishna they shud be thr... They have great book and audio visual stuff as well to buy?",1
"Nice enough inside, good overall experience. Nothing special. I've been to other ISKCON temples that were more serene and relaxing where you could really feel the vibe a bit more. Nowhere to relax and enjoy the atmosphere, too busy and commercialised for me.",0
Go for peace and addend the evening aarti. Even some good camps are organized by temple admins. Good place to energized yourself after busy schedule. Must visit if you are in Bangalore.,1
"ISKCON are know for there standards in quality temples around the world. But its a long walk up before you get to the temple, but its worth the walk. Clean & specious. Anyone with difficulties they have a lift to take you up, straight to the temple area.",1
The ISKCON temple in Bangalore is maintained very well. Poojas and rituals are done in style and as per scriptures. Food on the campus is well prepared and tasty. The temple idols are very beautiful and well decorated. There are few rooms for ISKCON members to stay too but these rooms are to be booked well in advance. They also conduct several classes on Spiritual issues.,1
Brilliant atmosphere and a peaceful ambience.,1
Amazing experience good spiritual and cultural center,1
The temple is a structural beauty in the heart of the city. Great views and pleasant visit.One time visit is recommended,1
"Same as any other ISKCON temple, with lot of commercialization which is a norm nowadays in ISKCON. People who like temples will like it anyways, architecture wise pretty normal. For those seeking peace, crowd and commercial stalls are going to make it very tough.",0
Night view of temple is very beautiful with lighting and fountains. Area is very clean and well maintained. Proper management of devotee's from entry to exit. Inside temple many options of food courts available.,1
"Hare Rama, Hare Krishna this melody will go to your ear & mind as you enter the premises, its very nicely managed & clean. you have to stand in a que to get Darshan, when you enter the temple you will get relaxed & forget all the tensions, you can sit for a while & enjoy the relax environment. only thing is that while coming you have to pass all the stalls at the exit you will get Khichdi as bhog prasad which is very very tasty.",1
In India the best temple,1
Good business on the name of god....,0
Very beautiful temple. Clean maintained. Very peaceful temple to be relaxed.,1
Hare Krishna hare Krishna Krishna Krishna hare hare hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare hare,1
"Visited the temple in February 2013, his beauty surpassed all expectations, perhaps, this temple is the most beautiful of all seen me. Impresses the same organization, for that would get in a few laps must read the Maha mantra Hare Krishna, which would acquire the necessary state of mind. A visitor to the temple rises gradually from the bottom up, first receives preliminary darshan of Srinivasa, when it appears in the altar room, it exceeds all expectations, the temple was built in full accordance with the tradition of Vastu, the sun shines from the east at sunrise, at sunset in the west - very nice. In the center of deities Radha Krishna ...... After visiting the altar, when visitors go down, it is possible to buy souvenirs and luxury MAHAPRASAD ...",1
"ISKCON Bangalore provides free food to those in need. The Akshaya Patra Foundation is one of the initiative started by members of the temple, which has received praise from United States President Barack Obama for feeding and educating children across India",1
Devotional place to spend some time in Bangalore. Went there on a weekend and it was really crowded but its worth the wait and the queue. A must visit if you are in Bangalore.,1
"brilliant, the way it is located and the view you get from there. the best part about it is the way it is build and the peace that one gets on sitting in the temple and its premises",1
It is really a good place to make our mind positive.,1
Its a nice temple ...108 mantra its jolly top of the temple its nice and is big and snacks is nice,1
Well maintained modern temple with diviness.Worth a visit with well organised entry and car park etc.It is better to take nidhya seva on busy days which is for max of 6 people and we could complete in 30 minutes.,1
"It is an amazing place, when you enter temple you feel the Lord Radhe Krishna is standing in front of you and welcomi...",1
Nicely built temple and a lot of community outreach programs.,1
Iskon temple is near yesvantpur railway station. The temple is clean and runs systematically. But duing exit there are too many shops in the name of business. Avoid them,1
It is one finest place in bangalore to visit and stay there for some time with family and friends i visited this last Sri krishna's Birthday i am planning to go there for this year also,1
"Lord Krishna's temple. Worth visiting once. Nice temple.It's located in North Bangalore, near yashwanthpur area.",1
"Very well managed, right from shoe/chappal deposit/collection to queue system for the darshan. Although parking is available, but i would advice to take a cab to this place. Not a good idea to take kids on certain occasions like Krishna Janmastami, temple gets over crowded.",1
"Must visit in Bangalore trip. Nice and clean ,can sit and meditate. Small snick snacks are available inside temple which can be bought as souvenirs.",1
AS per the norms of the ISKCON the place is kept very neat and tidy. Worth for a peaceful area and soul searching. Can spend 3-4 hours worth going in afternoon in order to avoid the rush,1
"This is such a legendary place and I couldn't help myself but get happily exited for having an opportunity to visit. We arrived at the late PM hours, were very exhausted from the bumpy travel from Tamil Nadu, so my experience would have been maybe different if I had visited under the different circumstances? I remember recorded tune of "" hare krishna"" mantra coming from the speakers - all over . I also remember the big line to get in ,regular drill"" shoes off, camera checked... + tons of enthusiastic western tourists all over. Many of them dressed as hippies :) .Temple itself is mesmerizing but too many things were going on it wasn't as easy to get in touch with inner spirituality as it was at many others temples. I wish it was less commercialized - but I am still glad I went.",1
Excellent,1
The temple is build over a huge property but is well maintained. Parking is easily available. The temple does get crowded during the weekends and its best to opt for the fast seva that being in the general queue.,1
"Evening aarti will reinstate the association of your inner soul with divinity. Only drawback is even for keeping your footwears secured, you are made to play, though a couple of bucks, something entirely different from when you visit a Gurudwara",1
"Amidst the chaos outside,its very peaceful & beautiful inside the temple.Neat and clean.Can also visit the landmark kitchen-Akshayapatra.",1
Peace of mind?,1
Place of worship to visit and get blessings of Lord Krishna. Visit to temple keeps make us with blessings of God with good health and prosperity.,1
I liked it.......... good management. Nice..........,1
Best time to go is Krishna Janmashtami.,1
Its like 5 star temple.. even divinity has a class here.. you should go through restaurants to exit this temple which...,0
Clean place,1
"Try to make it to the mahamangalarati at around 8 PM. It's a good experience. But, be prepared for crowds. Not too much but plenty. The stalls are pretty commercialized.",1
"A surprising visit to a very ""clean"" white temple. Hare Krishna was experienced in a very serene way. Even an atheist worth to attend the actual ceremony evening. You immediately feel included in their community, although you are not a part of having to make out .. More than worth a visit in the busy city center of Bangalore. A refreshing break!",1
Perfect place for spiritual motivation,1
"Temple is nicely built and is loved by whomsoever visit it. It gives a great view from top of temple and deities are so adorable. +ve is the everything Only thing i think should change is the commercialization of the place. They have food stalls, and various other selling on offering on your way out. Why is it? Nevertheless its my views so sorry if anyone is hurt.",1
Ultimate!!! Speechless.. Hare Krishna!!!,1
"Neat, clean, well maintained n organized. It is very well-built and spacious. Its a peaceful plus architectural deli...",1
isckon temple is one of the wonderful and golden temple and excellent around the world. i really appreciated this temple.,1
"Has that good imformation the god SHREE KRISHNA SWAMY BHAGAVAN,bangloore,WONDER FULL GOD.",1
"The night Aarti (the last offering )to Lord Radha Krishna is an amazingly soul stirring experience. After the ceremony, the devotees burst into music, dance and live pure joy, This hilltop temple built by ISKCON takes the believers and the non believers to a soul stirring journey, A delightfully spiritual experience",1
A good place to visit for religious people and even if you are not religious still go the architecture is wonderful inside must see,1
Excellent Darshan,1
"Temple is having lots of steps.. and is really grand.. cameras are not allowed.. Its very peaceful inside.. the ceiling has paintings of lord krishna's childhood on it.. which are mesmerizing .. its easy to reach withing bangalore.. There are shops inside selling lots and lots of artefacts, idols, etc.. really a must visit.. do take ur parents wth u..",1
There is a lot o people coming in and over and so one will not fell the serenity that we usually found in a temple. Very long queue is there and they are selling a lot of things including notebooks and laddu. You can see the Radha Krishna prathishta and all which is not very common.,0
The ambience and atmosphere is excellent. Cleanliness is next to godliness. This you can see here.it gives you an unforgettable experience. Which you carry forward throughout your life,1
Everything is krishna.... hare krishna please chant this maha mantra... thank you.,1
"bureaucratic place, necessary to take the shoes and leave specific and paid sites ... you can not get to them in the backpack. The landscape (for photos) is not very good because the temple is behind several walkways with poly carbonate cover, which impoverishes the other location. Its interior is beautiful.",0
"Leave your shoes in the car or with the shoekeeper (2 rupees/pair) and enter. It's free, so unless you want to buy an offering or blessing, ignore the man doing the hard sell of tickets for 300-1,000 rupees! Also leave your camera in the car. Security check for men and women before entering (mobile phones ok, just no cameras). Walk through and enjoy. Built in May 1997. Plenty of opportunities to buy Hare Krishna publications (I did buy a vegetarian cookbook here with excellent instructions for Americans w/measurements) for 300 rupees. Bring an appetite because there are many food vendors within the temple complex to get some snacks and sweets! 30 rules for parking. Very glad we visited.",1
The temple is very big and grt.Its really a big temple..Canteen is good with delicious prasad.There were so many shops inside temple there you can buy lots of things realted lord krishna.And lots of books also available there in so many languajes.,1
Truly religious and good strategy of marketing of things inside complex.,1
We had been there to attend a marriage. I have been here several times to attend marriage reception. I like the temple style food here. The idlis are soft and delicious. Food is the best part. The marriage halls are spacious and clean.,1
"The ISKCON is located on the heart of the elevation that gives you a intensified pleasure of happiness. The ambience of the temple is no less than adobe of god which is filled with eternal love & bliss. As soon as you step in the temple our souls & heart start dancing in ecstasy of joy & happiness. You would love spend life looking at Krishna & radha, the processions all others is absolute beauty. I would bet you is heaven on earth, preachings of the gurus all makes you get relived from all your worries & pain.",1
It is a beautiful temple with a highly divine ambience. A must visit place in Bangalore. But the way it has been converted into a place for commercialism by the authorities is something that should not be there in a religious place.,1
"Bhagwan krishna's puja, worship with dance n chanting gives immense satisfaction..deep relaxation to mind. It feel ve...",1
"good place, to know Radhika devi dasi passed from this world by the blessings of Guru and Gouranga on Radhastami at 5:05 pm. The quietness of the temple and beautiful idols would really impart lot of mental peace to you",1
Iskcon temple is always fascinating and religious .This is the 3rd Iskcon temple i visit .. thank god at the time of morning prayer i manage to visit.. its a totally different experience when u become a part of all devgan at the time of prayer. In bangalore the thing i dont like.. so many restrictions . * Like i am unable to reach or check the toppest point of this temple and they banned to go near the boundaries of top floor of the temple Visited February 2015,0
"Keep Chanting.. ""Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare... Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare""... Incredible and Invaluable place... Its Feels Very Special to be in Devotional Path. Felt So Happy With Lord Krishna's Darshan..Hope You all will get the Same and feel the same.May that Lord Krishna Shower All His Merciful blessings on You and all your family members.. Radhe Radhe..",1
Quite impressive and helpful staff explaining the religion.,1
Iskcon is fully peacefull place...several times i visit.,1
"This ISKCON Temple is very well located on top of a hill and offers a great view of the surroundings . It is splendidly built in white marble and always kept spic and span . Except for festival days enables the visitor to get a darshan of the deities , reasonably fast . Anyway the queue for the darshan is well organised . There are good eating possibilities within the complex as well as a luxury vegetarian food restaurant High on Taste offering sattvic delicacies.",1
"If you are going to Bangalore, you must visit this Temple...",1
It is a shopping mall more than a temple. 1000 rs for a pushpanjali! Commercialized every aspect of krishna. Nothing more than a business.,0
"A place where GOD recedes (actually it's everywhere ) is a place where one cane open his heart.. among her busy schedule places like ISKCON temple help us to be momentarily be with one self and help us talk to our soul. A small journey where we sharing of joy or sorrow can bring tears.. At ISKON, people are working hard and trying their best for everyone to get the darshan of Radhe - Krishna : the eternal beautiful friendship or love..",1
I visited three temples including this one and it was so unique and beautiful. I enjoyed seeing the incredible architectural details and the attention to detail that made this such a beautiful temple.,1
Best place...peacefull place...not only because it's a temple....the architecture of the temple is awesome..i love iskcon,1
The temple is located near the orion mall. The temple has very pleasant environment where we can forget all our issues and relax well.,1
"Interesting and very local visit this temple dedicated to Krishna. But the temple itself, it is the environment where many Indians are directed to visit or pray. Worth a visit",1
"I am from Kolkata.Visited ISKCON BANGALORE on first day of Damodar month,i.e. 18 october.Very nice experience.Will visit again.HARE KRISHNA",1
The temple is so nice and clean and looks too rich. Only temple that I've seen in my life with such a silent and divine place.,1
Divine place. Good for meditation and spirituality. Commercialized now.,1
"Like most ISKCON temples, it is a very serene place. Also, this temple has multiple floors with different deities. The Radha krishna deities are very beautiful and not like the ones we see in other ISKCON temples. They have a South Indian touch to their attire and shringar. Also, the Venkatesh balaji darshan here is breathtaking. You can buy delicious pure vegetarian prasad here at the temple eateries. Awesome experience.",1
"Beautiful and serene, this temple is a must visit if you are in Bangalore. Hindu devotees may attend the prayers. Souvenirs and incense etc are sold in the temple. No cameras allowed into the temple- have to leave behind at security checkpoint.",1
This place was really serene and peaceful. And the view of this temple at night is really nice. Best time to visit this temple is in evening when they light the lamps inside the temple .,1
"We used to visit monthly twice , and I swear this is the best place if you want to get peace from city life.",1
We visited this temple in May. Its a beautifully sculpted temple situated on a hillock and provides great views of areas around. The insides too are worth watching though I was a little put off by all the commercial activities going on inside. Buy only if you need to. The prasadam is given at the end after one has gone through the entire gamut of shops housed inside the temple. They give free langar / lunch coupons daily at 11:00 am so plan accordingly.,1
"We stayed at Vivanta by Taj. This temple is about 4 kms away from the hotel. Took a cab. Easy accessible. Number of stairs to ride before you reach sanctorum. It is a great mesmirising temple with well decorated Lord Krishna, Radha, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda and other dieties. Singing and chanting was a great experience and delightful. Wish had more time to sit. Palki ceremony before closure of the daily chores, was another great experience.",1
The biggest and most beautiful temple in Bangalore..the visit to Banglore is incomplete without visiting this temple with thousands of devotees visiting every day..the entry is so huge and the statues so beautiful and decorated and looks lively..lot of shops within the temple selling religious literature and gifts and big arrangement for selling quality food items.. Must visit,1
Its a wonderful place to travel... Full of positivity. Jai Shree Krishna,1
It was a wonderful experience to go Iskcon temple I stayed there 2 hours and found peace of mind after that I took parsadam lunch which was amazing. In total it was wonderful experience.,1
"A clean and well organized temple. Even though thousands throng the temple complex on week days and even more on festival days, atmosphere remains serene. Religious activities go on seamlessly with lines of devotees/visitors patiently awaiting their darshans or just able to bypass the throng and carry on to the next leg. A very long walk with some climbing involved. Not all places are wheel chair friendly. From what I could see there are lots of members/volunteers handling the action very efficiently entry till exit. They do serve some wholesome prasadam. Can buy religious artefacts, books, book Poojas, food, handicrafts and few touristy items",1
No cameras and photographs are allowed inside. but they collect baggage and cameras in a protective way and easy for us roam with it afterwards. pure and clean. had a peaceful mind there,1
This is am impressive temple building especially beautiful when lighted at night. I participated in the puja and ate at the temple lunch with my friends. There is a book sales area where people are willing to answer questions about their religious practices.,1
"The modern building is interesting. When you are inside the temple is white with a spacious hall where people sit and sing. But in the same hall there are monks selling books and it doesn t seem so spiritual. On the way to the exit, you pass a long market with people selling any sort of merchandising. Even if you don t want to buy, you buy something. Never seen in any other temple in the world.",0
One of my favourite palace. I visit very often. This temple makes my mind cool and calm. I love to visit this place in bangalore.,1
Its ok,0
Excellent construction. Must see the shrine,1
Temple is located at Nice place. I like aminities in Temple premises more than temple. Nice Food to eat in cafeteria.,0
Peace,1
"One of largest Iskcon temples, where you can find spiritual books, bakery/eatery within the temple complex. It's a commercial place.",1
Nice place to see but is very commercial. You could easily spend 3 hours at this temple. the ambience is good.,0
"This temple has been fully commercialised. Huge money appears to have been spent to develop this temple. Unfortunately, whether it is in performing the puja or selling of too many eatables, in the garb of ""prasadam"" or even soliciting the devotees to purchase books of higher cost, in the main hall itself, robs the place of all the sanctity.",1
Everything is well managed and signboards made sure that no one has to ask anyone to visit such a big and beautiful temple.,1
"They have build this tample to earn money. Everywhere they created stalls and the path is around those stalls and you ave to apss though each stall. No peace at all. Delhi Isckon temple is better than this,",0
It's great,1
"I feel very proud to say that there is a branch of this Iskcon very close to our village in DHADIBHAVI. Really it is filling a good culture in children as well as in youth. Moreover it teaches how to lead self dependent life. It is very affectionate towards cows and other oxen. It also helds programmes on LORD SRI HARI KRIAHNA ,brings gentlemen from Mumbai and foreign to speak on & Also transform their respective languages to local one I.e. KANNADA. I wish all the best Iskcon to do more social w",1
"Great piece of art, nice place and great experience in temple. Clean and neatly maintained. Must visit place.",1
Very well developed temple with so many activities and they make sure u don't miss anything u r journey is well guide by management u start with bhagvan Puja and end with pet Puja that means food u r stomach feed,1
"One of the must visit temple in Bengaluru. Shrine is wonderful. Lots of stalls inside. Whatever u buy in some stalls go for the needy. Chanting of Hare Ram, Hare Krishna is soothing to ears.",1
Simple delicious organic veg prasadam.I wonder how they manage all this with their signature AkshayaPatra Scheme,1
Place is great but they made it business on the name of God. But this is not the only worship place which is doing so?,1
"Anything but a spiritual experience. Go there to eat ice creams, cakes, samosas at marked up prices. You will find fo...",0
"The temple is managed extremely well by ISCKON and one feels at peace while at the temple. Sometimes the queques are long , but they do take care not to turn away any people",1
"This place is been maintained well.spacious place around the temple.The prayers touch your inner soul because a person can sit peacefully and also see the pooja, what they perform in the evening",1
Hare krishna hare rama ... Awesome place. No word for explain.,1
"This is a must visit spot when you are in Bangalore. From the architecture to the vibes and the energy, you won't be sorry spending a few ours here. The only downside is that it is a tad commercial but then that's pretty much the case with most devotional places these days. But the overall experience is memorable. The chanting (whether you are a believer or not) is very mesmerizing and the food choices are yummy. The system is very well organised and even with a huge crowd, things are managed pretty well. If you are in Bangalore and have a few hours to spare, consider this.",1
A Place where you will find peace and relax all your sadness and worries and feel comfortbale. a place where people come with tensions and go with relaxation...!!,1
"This measure is a branch of the International Society for Krsna Consciousness. (International Society for Krishna Consciousness: ISKCON) the largest in the world. Agree that the spectacular and magical. Idol worship and to sacrifice. (There is a similar measure for our guests), but when I walked out. Depressed fall from heaven to hell. To go through hundreds of shops and restaurants. This is a Sikh temple or shopping together. Maze is a long corridor It took a walk over. Dad throws shoes at the door to pay for it. Everything is money out ... anyone preparing to take photos. Keep it in the car because a scanner like the airport. If the attached To claim that the movie does not I do not want to ... I need to travel out of town for hours. (Traffic from the construction of the train), this measure is not worth it to visit.",0
"I visited this place on a weekend and my review might just be a little tainted due to the weekend rush. I love temples and architecture. I like the serenity and the peace. But ISKCON temple was too crowded and I was left a little worked up. It was a Saturday and I had visitors from another country interested in going to ISKCON so we planned and left Koramangala at 11.00am. By the time we reached the location it was nearing 2.30pm. I would blame this time laps on weekend rush. Then we went in to the temple from one side after buying the tickets. The structure was plain white. And it looked more plain and angular then the usual structural beauty of Indian temples. We took the tour and I tried to absorb as much as i can but frankly speaking I was just waiting to leave due to the crowd. we finally managed to reach the place where they serve food. By the time we got out of the temple it was a tiring experience. May be next time I would go on a weekday, that might solve the crowd issue.",0
It is situated near Sandal soap factory. It is a holy temple for Hindu. God Radha Krishna stay here. Surrounding is picturised.,1
"Hi, i visited Iskcon temple with my friends. Its really good place and nice botanical set way of temple inside. Inside awesome architectural ceiling and gold plated eye catching design, good reflection of positive vibrations. Thanks.",0
Liked: huge well maintained temple with amazing main hall and stunning deities. Disliked: compelled into going through chanting steps to get inside and eating/shopping areas to get outside,1
The orderliness within the temple without the jostling and rushing as in other south Indian temples is very pleasing. Very It takes about one hour or less to do your puja and exit this temple.,1
Iskon is one the best temples in bangalore. Best time to visit is after noon around 4 on weekdays when you will find less rush. Also there is a good restaurant inside which offers excellent food. Visited November 2013,1
"I had visited the temple on a week day and it was a very lovely experience. As the sun went down, we stepped inside the huge hall where the sound of the bhajans filled the air. There is a very peaceful feeling once you stand before the deities. Don't forget to sit down for some time on the floor and meditate.",1
Nice place,1
"It's a Very good Radhe Krishna Temple situated near to Yaswantpur (Bangalore) railway station. It is situated on the top of a hill with ample of car parking space. It took around 3 hours for Harinama Darshan & Main temple Darshan, Prasad and free lunch prasad. The best part of temple visit is recitation of Shree Rama mantra for 108 times in Harinama Darshan visit.",1
Businesses in every single step .... each and every product is very costly.,0
Very organized and clean.,1
Really You get Piece of mind in this temple & Bajan & Prasada was good you really see once in life .,1
commercialized place...,0
A place which teaches u how to go back to godhead,1
"Its located far from shopping area. The temple is big. They will charge INR300 rupees for family darshan eventhough there is no queue. You have to walk around 20 minutes before reaching the main deity which is Lord Krishna. Once you complete the darshan, they will lead you to an area where there are two or three people sitting . They will then start to explain about the temple and they are in the process of building another temple which they claimed will be the tallest temple in the world. After that they will propose to you various kind of membership to ISCKON which the cost ranges from INR50,000 to 1 lakh. If you not interested then they will ask for donation. You can always say no and proceed to go to book stall. The exit is designed in a way that you have to pass all this areas. At the book stand they will promote various book . There are a lot of small stall which will be selling temple related items before you actually exit. I felt that I need to carry a lot of money if I am visiting temples.",1
"Bangalore ISKCON is one of the largest ISKCON's in Asia and like most of their temples, it is a clean place which is managed properly. Visiting the sanctum sanctorum is really an amazing experience. It is best to go early as lines to build up during the day, but even then it is well managed. Enough places to eat...higher taste is a really classy place to have food. Visited December 2013",1
Great temple to visit. Very Neat & Clean. you get a peace of mind after you come out from there. There are good malls near by the temple where you can spend quality time. First time visitors should never miss the ISKCON and they should visit and get the blessings from Lord Krishna,1
"A very clean temple, great for visitors to experience. While it is popular with locals, I always like to take out of town/country visitors here.",1
"Very peaceful temple with hare rama chanting. the visit to various temples inside the temple is memorable.Inside the temple, the main diety is wonderfull and never forgettable in life.",1
this is a lovely beautiful temple. Must go when u in city.A beautiful temple . Nice approach in bangalore. Prasadma is really good. Neat and clean . Prefer time to go in evening or early morning. I often keep going there. Food court is better and can be more improved. Stalls are good to collect some home stuffs.,1
Super pleased,1
"we had visited mumbai eskon..compared to mumbai this is very well maintained, opened in different time. please do visit bangalore iskon if you are in garden city. Bus routes - BUS NO 402,308, OR ANY BUS which routes through yespuntpur and west-of-cord road",1
Its a lovely place to visit.so peaceful n calm whike doing aarathy we feel so heavenly dat we hv seen lord krishna directly....u can relaxly walk inside da temple as its too big....if u r travelling to bangalore n if u miss iscon temple its a loss of happiness n peace..,1
like the place but no space for parking. Too steep stairs. Exhausted. Had to wait too long in the front although the timing is right .,1
A beautiful place but too much regulated queues....did not feel the spiritual vibes that one expects from such a place...much too commercialized .....but the food sold here is really good and the variety is nice !,0
"We stay very near to the ISKCON temple and have visited here a number of times with the guests who come to our house. This is a Krishna temple, on a small hillock, which is one of the star attractions in Bangalore. The decorations around the main deity is amazing and you can sit down for some time leisurely. This is not like any other typical temple, where we can offer flowers and perform 'Abhishek'. What was really amazing was the amount of snacks (including cake) which was available after you finish all the darshan. There are a number of stairs, which the elderly persons should take care. If you have a car, then you can drive inside the temple to the top. Lot of crowd during the 'Ekadashi' day. Half a kilometre from ISKCON, there is a beautiful Hanuman temple, which is worth visiting.",1
Be prepared for long queues if you go on a festive day or weekends. The temple is nicely built on a small hillock with beautiful view of the neighborhood. The evening aarti is really enchanting. Worth a visit.,1
the feel and atmosphere will make you feel very pleasant its a place to really relax your mind and devote to the lord,1
This temple gives me a bit of modern temple feel. There is a shop within this temple too. Not a place which I would like to visit again and again.,0
Krsna is supreme personality of godhead.. I loved to go everyday.. so pleasent and peaceful environment ..it's an amazing temple in bangalore... even temple is well maintained.... love u my lord ??,1
Very serine and most well maintained Morden day temple. It's one of must visit venue of bangalore. Make sure to take children to this temple and experiance unique theatre showcasing Sri Krishna Leela movies all days.,1
I felt this temple to be very commercial. Very clean and well maintained. It is an air conditioned temple. Worth visiting as a tourist attraction not as a pilgrimage.,1
"Hi tech temple, nice place to visit and learn about Krishna's mythology. The organisation does excellent work in feeding school children through its Akshayapatra scheme. supplies nutritious vegetarian mid day meals to a number of schools. has an excellent restaurant in its premises which serves excellent satvic food.",1
Peaceful atmosphere,1
Unexplainable,1
If you are in Bangalore and wanted to see beautiful architecture. Iscon will be in your priority list. Prefer afternoon time rush is less.,1
Grand Sri Krishna Temple. All glories to the Vaishnavas.,1
One of the largest and famous temple in Bangalore. People's likes to visit this place.,1
The visitors of banglore must visit here atleast once. enchanting the name of krishna continuously makes the whole atmosphere spiritual. the evening view of sunset from the top of the temple is really beautiful. the most memorable thng in the temple was the glimpse of the temple in the glasses just opposite to the main statue. overall a good experience.,1
Such a beautiful and we'll maintained Temple in Bangalore..,1
I always have a wonderful experience and my visit pumps my spiritual levels.,1
Calm Place....Visited with my family. One should must visit this place with their family in Bangalore.,1
It's a beautiful temple and built nicely. A must see temple during the visit to city and different than other ISKCON temples.,1
Awesome Architecture. Beautifully maintained and cleaned. Peaceful,1
"Its is the best devotional experience in North Bangalore. Its proximity to the other temples like Anjaneya and Balaji Temple nearby totally makes Mahalashmi Puram as the Devotional Hub. Connectivity to the Metro exists from Mantri Mall and Peenya Industry Stations. There is a Metro Station named after ISCKON itself, where one needs to get down to visit the great temple",1
Do visit the ISKCON temple and enjoy the food at the enarby restaurant. Also the prasad inside is very good. The knowledge sessions on Sri Krishna is also very good,1
Peaceful place,1
I visted Iskcon temple for 2 times in my banglore stay. It was pleasant experience and awesome location.,1
One of the most prominent tourist place s in Bengaluru. Clean and well managed. A must visit place in Bangalore,1
Peaceful and excellent environment.near mahalakshmi metro available.,1
Very good to go in the mornings - spiritual and quiet but too much traffic to get here. As per driver - it should have taken 25 minutes but we cam here after 2 hours - Bengaluru traffic is very high inside city area..,1
"A must visit even if you are not the temple going types. Beautiful Sri Krishna idols, very clean and well managed temple area. Try and avoid holidays and other religious days as it tends to get overcrowded. The staff is very informative and parking space is available. Must visit.",1
Most peaceful and holy place to visit.,1
I hail from a place whereI live next to Sri Durga Temple. When ever I step inside the temple it has got a spiritual environment. ISKCON lacks that. Its is very commercialized temple.,0
Great place! Well organized and serene. Helpful devotees.,1
"Had a good visit, except for the crowd. Spend some time in temple by meditating. Which would bring us some peace even in such huge crowd",1
Very nice & well arranged. I liked very much.,1
Very Good,1
"I love the location ... I love the temple part of ISKCON.... The place is disciplined and clean. But the part that bothers me is the feeling I get of walking through a shopping area when I come out of the temple... you walk through endless shops for food, books, artefacts, paintings etc., and that takes away the temple feeling. When I go to a temple, I like to go to a temple and not a blend of temple and shopping area. Been there a few times but not very excited about going back...",0
i have been to nearly all the iskcon temples in india. they all have beautiful atmosphere but the one in bangalore tops to no 1 position . its so beautiful with magnificient architecture . it is nicely maintained by the management . the stais can b a little tiring but at the end the result is so fruitful . Ty visiting it duing their evening puja time its amazing to see . the view from above is beautiful,1
"It is a religious place, clean and well maintained. It is very crowded on weekends and public holidays.",1
One of fantastic ISKCON Temple In India.good location with cool atmosphere,1
Architecture at ISKON Bangalore is average with not much to like. Also you cannot photograph in bangalore which is allowed in other temples of ISKON - Pune and Mumbai.,0
I had previously never visited any ISKCON temple. This was my first time Very peaceful place to visit near Yelahanka Area in Bengaluru.,1
Hare Krishna! Best place and a mind soothing place in Bangalore! Viakunta on Earth! Interactions with the devotees @ Iskcon Temple at realising one's self!,1
very much different from other iskons in india,1
Truly spiritual....Hare Krishna,1
Radha Krishna madira is excellent. No word's to speak out.,0
This is Vaikunta of Bangalore,1
Nice krishna temple and good food well cleaned temple i loved it,1
"Cool,Calm and pleasant. One should experience the spirituality of Lord Krishna and have Prasadham there.",1
Well maintained and so clean and tidy. One thing i hate is too much of queue and lots of marketing strategies in the name of devotion. Except these too a good place to visit.,1
Peaceful Wonderful Fully blessed the day .... Night is awesome feeling,1
What a temple...I just loved it ...,1
"Feels more like a 5-star hotel than a temple. Location is great, very clean but this is no spiritual or calming experience, specially when the shops are 10 meters from the sanctum sanctorum! The best part about this place is the Higher Taste restaurant, you should not miss this at any cost.",0
"If you are an Indian with slight inclination towards religion then you of course would be aware what ISKCON stands for and probably you might have visited one of their centers already. In this case, there is nothing special for you to see here, except an exceptional kitchen and an all veg restaurant. If you do not fall in the...",1
Incredible temple with great divine ambiance. Must visit place if you are in Bangalore.,1
"We visited this temple with kids in Feb. It's a beautiful temple in midst of hustle bustle of Bangalore, a peaceful location. I specially liked the 108 steps where everyone says Hare Krishna mantra on each step. Must visit",1
We visited the temple late afternoon while still daylight but by the time we came out of the temple it was dark. So glad we saw it both in daylight and whilst lit up it was a magnificent sight. Everyone was really helpful and guided us. It was breathtaking and we are so glad we chose to visit this particular temple. On the way out there are many items for sale which are all very reasonably priced (very cheap in fact).,1
"Located on a hilltop this temple draws huge crowds every day and specially on festive occasions. The entire process in reaching the temple altars is a spiritual experience chanting the mantra all the way. For senior citizens unable to climb the steps, lifts are available to reach you right inside the temple's sanctum sanctorum. Darshan is orderly and there is no pushing. For those interested in shopping for curios plenty of puja items to pick up for home and as gifts for family. There are restaurants inside the premises serving all types of cuisines.",1
Visited the temple on Sunday around 12:30 pm. Main hall was full of engraved structures and huge picture frames of Lord Krishna. Khichdi was really tasty. One advice- Check timings before planning.,1
Wow absoutely beautiful. I could feel the devine intervention through prayer at ISKON. The food was great. The people was friendly warm and it was peaceful to pray at this temple.Visited March 2014,1
I am no one to rate a temple. But if you are willing to spend few hours with yourself in a peaceful aura . Please do visit ISKCON Temple,1
Holy place for Hindus.,1
"It was the first time that we visited a Krishna temple and this was a very interesting visit. When the temple opened there were thousands of followers that streamed into the temple. We followed a separate route but ended up seeing all the ""gods"" and eventually also arrived in the mail hall where we were invited to join in the offerings. When we turned it down it was graciously accepted. It is suggested that you leave your shoes in the car/taxi as they ask you a small fee per pair to keep safe but the guy accepting the shoes ""does not have change"" thus ending you up costing much more.",0
"Very well maintained overall You will get peace of mind if you spend about half an hour there. Location wise also very good( very near to Orion mall,yeshwanthpur) A bit too much of religious shopping points though",1
ISKON temple in Bangalore is a must visit. This is one of Krishna temple. It is very beautiful and will take about 2-3 hours to visit.,1
Nice Temple to visit if you are in Bangalore. Nice and reasonable restaurant/shopping complex inside,1
"First of all, it is the best place to visit for both beauty as well and timepass. The temple is on a small hillock. We can either drive to the top or walk through either by road or by steps. The best thing is the cleanliness as well as the decoration of the deities. After visiting the main deity, we need to walk through the commercial shops run by ISKCON team. The collection is huge as well as the cost is nominal. We can spend good time is shopping... The different shows available like sound and light etc are nice and worth watching. Only thing missing is holiness.",1
"This was my first visit to Iskcon temple. Right from the time i stepped in the temple, the mind became calmer and calmer and the tensions just evaporated. Would strongly advise a visit to this place for seeking calmness. The idols placed there are also marvellous, just cannot take your eyes off them.",1
"It is situated atop a hill. It is one of the most well managed temples. People from far and near visit. It is like an excursion. Apart from the famous temple one can have other nice experiences. The Arial view of the city, good food provided in the campus ( of course paid). The management also supports one of the largest philanthropic gestures. It feed around 50,000 school children - govt, needy and NGO schools across the city. It also boasts of one of the most modern clean kitchen. Lot of mementos to be carried back from the temple shops",1
"Very Good Temple ( Radha Krishna ). good place to spend a Day with family. you can reach this place using public transport, METRO. there is a fee for parking vehicle (2 and 4 Wheeler).",1
Hygiene keeping temple... But a small shopping center is also included inside the temple,1
"ISKCON, Chord Road Bengaluru has become a landmark and must-do on the Blore visitor's list today. We have been life members since the last 12 ours, so is our son. The temple is an architectural marvel, the shrines of Lord Narasimha & Bhakta Prahalada, Sri Venkateshwara and the main temple housing Sri Krishna. Sri Balarama and other dieties are a visual treat. Their books/magazines are published in multiple languages. It delights both the Indian and International soul. The ""Prasadam"" is tasty and pure (no garlic, onion!) It has a fine dining restaurant, amphitheater, clean washrooms, large parking space, proper facilities for footwear, easy access for senior citizens...these amenities add to the ease and joy of visit",1
Radha Krishna temple located in Bengaluru which is largest iskon temple in India...this place is very peaceful and calm.,1
"you are in the home of Krishna! a true immersion in Hinduism living what some say .... over again, to review, must come back constantly, there are different festivals all the time hare Krishna!",1
Me and my family had visited Iskcon last month. It had really been a great devotional experience. The entire compound is so well maintained and the main temple's vibration and all Deity's idol is beyond words. Amazing...,1
Good maintenance,1
Great and good a lord of krishna tample,1
Temple is made and organized in a grand way. At least I don't get a divine feeling when I visit because of the constant bustle and too many commercial activity going on. It's definitely worth a visit to experience the grandeur (with good appetite). You can fill yourself with the different prasads and there is full fledged restaurants within the compound.,0
Divine and peaceful place chants of Hare Krishna Hare Ram........,1
Nice place.,1
Iskcon is best peaceful place in Bangalore because of Lord Krishna,1
ISKCON Sri Radhakrishna -chandara temple is one of the largets temples in the world ..it is very beautiful place.. i visted that place...very nice see that place i enjoyed a lot ..........,1
"Aarthi/Pooja is excellent - Bajan take you to a different world - Focuses on Vaishnava philosophy - Prasad is amazing Ideal time to visit - 6.30 am or 6.30 pm Ideal days - Mon - Fri, weekends are over crowded This temple provides food for thousands of students, a task that must be truly appreciated",1
Compared to other iskcon temples. This is One of the best architecture. Nice place to visit,1
Hara rama Hara krishna Huge temple. Inside it having lot of shops.,1
"Place is good and is situated in a hilltop. However, the place is fully commercialized and for everything you need money.",1
"It was hugely crowded. No shorts for men or women allowed, and no sleeveless. Inside temple it is very very big and beautiful",1
"Nice temple, crowded on weekends... Sleeveless and shorts are not allowed.",1
Magnificent Temple.,1
Nice place,1
One of a famous tourist spot in Bangalore. The temple is maintained neat and clean. They do have marriage halls.,1
Built in 1997... The temple has become an Ingram part of the city. The architecture is worth a see even if you are not religious per se. It is located in the northern part of bangalore in rajahs Nagar.,1
"This is probably the best place in Bangalore to have some peace and spiritual relaxation. There is a queue for darshan, but the queue moves very fast and as soon as you come out, you get khichadi prasadam which is simply awesome.",1
It's ridiculous that people are busy selling you books and clothes and Bhagwan items at every nook and corner of the temple. The temple is designed in such a way that one has to exit through a long market place thus giving the sellers enough time and space to milk customers. Ridiculous Only positive is the restaurant there which has very good food but even that is not light on your pocket. Rates than can easily match a decent 4 star restaurant. People get swayed by the fact that it is chappan bhog and all that non sense when it is ultimately just food. Don't think I will ever repeat it unless I have no option,0
Nice temple,1
"As someone with little knowledge of Hindu tradition, the visit to the ISKCON temple was my first exposure to active Hindu practice. Thus, please pardon my naivety in my explanation of what we did/saw. :) We were dropped off by our taxi driver and dropped off our shoes at the entrance. We then walked through a line of gates and basically followed the crowd through the extent of the temple. There were some smaller shrines along the way, and then of course the large room at the end of the tour. We were then taken by some Hindu reading materials and asked if we had any questions. The end of the tour led through a line where many items were being sold.",1
Wow.. Superb.. Liked the temple a lot.. Not a fan of the eateries and publications.. Good experience though..,1
"If you are a spiritual person you will love Iskcon its a great place for meditation and bhajan, its a wonderful Temple",1
"This is my second time visiting ISKCON and it is still an amazing place to be . Though I am not a follower of Hare Krishna, the temple is so serene and beautiful that you cannot help falling in live with it. Getting there is a breeze so if you have hired a car etc , most would know to get you there. Place is very organised so as you enter you can leave you shoes ; you will be issued a ticket for this . But you are also required to leave behind your camera which is a shame but a common practice when you visit places of worship. Inside you would make you way through a series of plateau where you will see different deities as you make you way up. The building and surrounding is so clean and nice with marble / granit flooring everywhere. The main building is the top where you will find deities of Krishna . The strong wind that blows right through the building is very fresh and serene ...it is a wonderful feeling and you must stand there and appreciate this .. Once you have touring the main building you would be lead through a series of shops selling religious books, sweets and food till it brings you back to the place you left our shoes!. You can collect your camera and click away once you outside- get a zoom lens .",1
SUch a nice place situated in Bangalore. Very important place to be visited by tourists. Temple construction and art and paintings is mind blowing. I have visited 3 times and every time I feel great . Never Miss . Canteen is also there and so many places to be visted apart from main worship place. Prasadam is awesome,1
"It will take you to divine atmosphere, everywhere Lord Krishna and Hare Krishna chants. My first visit was in 2003 as a tourist, then it becomes regular when I was in Bangalore. You will get all information about Lord Krishna, they have books in all language. After darshan you can enjoy Animation film and lots of sweet dishes(for which you have to pay) and free prasad at exit. Specially go with your children, it will teach about our Great culture.",1
"Place is huge, fancy, and if you let your imagination, you would think we are back in time. Interesting experience, full of completely different culture aspects (to me at least...) . I enjoyed the place....",1
ISKON is an established temple of Lord Krishna with Radha. This is located in Rajajinagar near to Yashavanthapura way to Tumkur. Always people will flock in to this temple. In the premises you can get pure veg food and join bhajan. The accessibility is good.,1
such a divine place which made me to visit frequently & on special occasions,1
"Lots of eating options available on your way down. Don't forget to stop and sample all that you like dosa, samosa etc",1
One place in Bangalore where u can find a modern Temple is this hare Krishna hill iskcon Temple. The chanting of hare Krishna mantra keeps Ur soul at peace. Very well maintained Temple premises. A must visit place.,1
"This huge modern concrete temple in stark contrast to all the old buildings that you can see in India, but one must have visited the huge surprise ""altar"" gold plating of the main room (no pictures).",1
"if you want to see a commercial Tempal, we can see this one there we see every thing can be buy even PRASADAM have to pay for then we get , really if you have money you can spend there",1
Its a pieceful environment,1
"Sri Radha Krishna Temple (Hindi: ???? ???? ????? ?????? ) or [3] has deities of Radha and Krishna located at Rajajinagar, in the North Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world. Beautiful architecture & environment. Good facilities inside and around the temple. Visited October 2013",1
"I have visited several Isckon Temples in and outside India. The Temple is well maintained and location is also good. You can walk in at ease and offer your prayers, sit down and relax for a while listening to the chantings or observe Aarti. They server really nice food. And because of the nice location you also get to see nice Sunset from here. The place gets crowded on weekends specially during evenings so plan accordingly.",1
The Look of the Temple is Nice & Beautiful. Always Pepole were there to devote God....Hare Krishna,1
Facilities for darshan are best,1
Nice place and we came and peaceful time here,1
"To my mind Iskcon Temple Bangalore is one of the best Hare Rama Hare Krishna Temple which I have visited. Lord Krishna is same every where but when I say excellent means decor of temple, infrastructure, cleanliness, temple staff behavior, discipline, security etc. So far I have visited Iskcon Vrindavan, Delhi, Mumbai, Kanpur, Haridwar & Bangalore. I found Bangalore is more organized. Others to learn.",1
Its opening time is 7.30am to 1pm and 4.30pm to 7.30pm,0
"It was crowded on Sunday evening, but it's a great place to visit",1
"The temple has organised the flow of the devotees in a very organised manner. There are no long ques except on Sunday's, though you can beat the que by taking the VIP ticket for fast darshan. They have organised an excellent kitchen serving a vast variety of food items. Excellent place to visit for Darshan or simply sight seeing.",1
"Feels good... right from the entrance - took the steps... short ques on the day i visited, and into the main hall - peace!",1
Modernized form of temple. Different kind of experience.,1
"Though it takes more time to reach the place because of traffic, once you enter the place you feel relaxed and happy. Late evening is the best time to visit the place, chant mantras and immense yourself with divine feelings.",0
"Went there in the month of June it was raining that that and it has created a little mess. But on crowed it has no effect, place was still crowded, i was able to witness one of the evening aarti, the main temple decoration is beautiful. It is done with lots of flowers. This place also has outlet which sells fast food, but it was cold. One pure veg restaurant is also there in the campus, i didn't had food there but in Mumbai Iskcon it was delicious.",0
It was a sudden plan. We stay in Bangalore and thought of visiting a place that would be ideal for an evening visit. We were planning to visit this much hyped temple for quite some time now. Its a grand temple considered to be one of the world's largest ISKCON temple. There was a huge queue at around 8.30 pm when we reached for the darshan. This will give you a chance to marvel at the architecture of the temple which is majestic. Inside there is a Radha-krishna mini temples and a major hall in which these dieties are kept. Huge gatherings of people sit in this hall while the pooja is being done. surrounding it are the stalls to sell books by swamis and other souveniers to keep post the visit. there are passages within the temple that opens up to stalls selling various religious items. We were expecting a meal in the temple which is very famous but it came in once we have almost exited the temple. So that was a bit disappointing. This religious-cultural temple is heavily commercialized and didnt give me the peace i was looking for!,1
Very good,1
Great temple in heart of Bangalore.,1
Was a good experience in this temple. Spiritual environment and a very good infrastructure. Clean and neat always. A good place to visit with family.,1
"i went there once with one of my friend and trust me till the time i stayed in Bangalore for over 2 years, i used to visit this place once in every 3 months... amazing place for finding that peace and relaxation away from a busy metro life... loved to be here",1
"the best part is their crowd control strategy by asking people to follow the steps one by one during entry ,they have a movie hall to show films and a good food court",1
it's awesome. all glories to Srila Prabhupada,1
The ISKCON temple is very well maintained and it's a beautiful temple in while. The specialty here is the huge ladoo that is peculiar to the place.,1
A very beautiful place to hv a peaceful Nd healthy mind...if u are in Bangalore just go for once...u'll feel the inner peace and blessings.,1
Must visit place for tourists. In the center of city. Peaceful atmosphere. You have temple run canteen too.,1
The best and the most beautiful ISKCON temple in India also offers a great variety of vegetarian snacks and food.,1
Great place,1
Namo narayana,1
Devotees of Krishna throng here in large numbers to pay tribute to lord Krishna. It a great temple to visit in Bangalore.,1
"Beautiful but not as good as the one in Mumbai! The rooms were nice and maintained, and as usual ISKON food is very nice, but I was not impressed with the worship and organization.",1
Used to go often. Regular Bajan happens. Free food every day. A lot of shops to eat. Aarti is beautiful.,1
It was an awesome experience but one thing the product's rate are too high.,1
Very peaceful.,1
"It is place to get piece of mind. It is a place to CHant Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. It is a very big and require a day to enjoy fully.",1
"A huge temple attracting lots of visitors / foreigners. Quite clean and aesthetically planned. Once you enter the temple you become a part of the system which every visitor has to follow. You simply can not loiter and have to follow the prescribed routes to visit / exit the temple. The route gets congested for a lot of temple vendors selling variety of items including religious books, images of gods and various other wares along the whole route. One has to cover quite a distance following the prescribed path. It becomes very difficult if you are accompanied by children and need to carry them to protect them the sufferings of getting suffocated through the route due to heavy rush of devotees.",0
ISKCON Temple Bangalore is nice religious place to visit----you must visit for peace of mind stress free atmosphere and great architecture-lot of religious books in different languages available here---nice calenders with RADHA-KRISHNA Images and great sweets as prasadam----one who goes Bengaluru(Bangalore) should visit this temple-----,1
Really liked the place.... except they made it commercialized to to some extent. Good to watch the temple when it is lighted..,1
It is a neat & clean and huge temple in the northern part of city. It is well maintained temple. it has a huge hall &devotees can have darshan easily .,1

"More than a temple, It has become a tourist attraction in Bangalore, Nice and Neat temple with lot of options for shopping as well, Nice food stall also",1
The structure is mammoth and impressive. Management is equally efficient be it car parking or path to temple or food court. The aartis are highlight and dont miss the tasty prasad that you will get the the end for free.,1
The Look of the Temple is Nice & Beautiful. Always Pepole were there to devote God.,1
This is one of the best temple I have visited go for premium darshan you can enjoy a lot pujas will be done as a group approximately 30 minutes it will take,1
Nice temple and food is also good,1
The ISKON temple at Bengaluru is located in large spacious grounds . The entire temple complex is maintained very well. We had been in the evening and hence were able to participate in the evening Aarti. Overall a nice and peaceful place of worship to visit in Bengaluru.,1
"Being in ISKCON is amazing experience. You just forget all your tensions & worries as you enter the premises. Sit down in main temple, close your eyes & just be in touch with Lord Krishna. He will bring you peace of mind.",1
"Bangalore has some very beautiful temples throughout the city, though if you are in the vicinity of this one, it is a must see",1
"A Hindu temple, Lord Krishna.",1
I like this place,1
Best place to visit in Bangalore if you the fan of lord Krishna. this place has very good calmness about it.,1
Hare Krishna. This Temple is very nice for worship.,1
heart filled with devotionality during the visit,1
"I enjoyed this place. Vast complex. Neat and clean. Bought some mithai from here to take home for some devotee friends. We ended up consuming all of it while on our journeys. It was good, and tasty. Luckily we picked up more mithai in Mumbai.",1
The place was very neat and good maintenance. Inside of the temple was a great architecture and would amuse anyone with their procedures of worshiping the god. But the food mall near exit looked like a commercial store where few things will be sold for few extra bucks for making money from any devotee... As any one would spend on either food or devotional items.Visited July 2014,1
I was amazed by the way they maintain the temple... wow.. Felt so happy and that feeling is still haunting... loved every bit of it.. planning to visit there again with my whole family....,1
"This temple is not very traditional and old temple but modern and new temple, visiting temple, watching aarti is nice experience.",1
Nice discipline service & lovely atmosphere,1
brilliant temple complex and serene space in the bustle of the city must go devotional place and prasadam is amazing,1
"A huge and modern-looking Iskcon temple. If you're looking for traditional and quiet temples, the Bull temples inside ...",1
"a temple turned into business and money making. everything you come across has a rate, be it darshan or anything.",0
Must see. Its good to visit ISKON bangalore. Its well maintained place. Myself and my family liked it.,1
Avoid visiting the place on weekends. It is a little climb but the view from the top is beautiful. The architecture of the temple is amazing . While leaving they do offer you a plate of prasad.,0
"Have been visiting ISKCON at Yesvantpur since 1998, and the calmness one experiences here hasn't chnaged, despite the rapid growth of the area all around, and increase in commercial activity & traffic. The Temple is very well maintained, and crowd management is good. The deities are very well adorned throughout the year & a darshan during the evening aarti is...",1
"Nice place to get both things, god blessings and peaceful environment. good place to go with family, maintaining in good manner",1
"I have been to Mumbai Iskcon but visiting Bangalore temple was a superb feeling. This place is so calm, serene and is built at a huge area. Walking upto the main temple from the gate you will come across various small temples which makes your walk all the more blissful. The temple is open and windy. Best part of my...",1
"This temple is of lord Krishna is good to see on Krishna janmasthami, lot of devotees r there to see god",1
"Iskcon Temple Bangalore: 108 steps of chanting Hare Krishna Hare Rama is a very unique experience especially after 26 hours flight, 3.5 hour sleep, and 8 hours work meeting! Krishna Krishna Hare Hare ... it gives me energy! We went there in the evening. no shoes allowed, even not allowed in your purse. Of course, no photo either. Prepare to leave your shoes in the car. Cell phone is allowed. The chanting and service singing are amazing... worth the time.",1
Krishna hill - place of silence n godliness,0
"This is a Amazing place ,u feel so much peace and a divine power of spirituality will touch you Hare Krishna!!!",1
I visited this place in week end it was so rush. but apart from that it is really good. neat and tidy.,1
"ambiance and culture The temple has a unique way to calm down your temper. You must visit this temple whenever you are in Bangalore, the 108 times, chanting of Hare risna and Hare Rama before you visit the temple, clams you down from hectic city life. You must not miss the evening prayers Visited August 2014",1
"Its very beautiful and you can get a nice scenic view from the top where the temple is. If you wish to meditate or get a good relaxation ,do sit in the middle of the hall. Its quite crowded and the parking can be a mess many a times.",1
"Built on the top of a hill, ISKCON becomes much more attractive in the day time with sunlight reflections. The paintings and the culture followed is nice.",1
"This is a Beautiful place and an Excellent Temple in a picturesque location. After the Darshanam of all the Gods have the prasadam at the Temple. Also varieties of tasty food stuff is available inside the Temple. There is a star Hotel at the back of the temple ""HEIGHER TASTE"" One has to eat there.This is the only hotel attached to the Temple where on can taste the excellent food. One cannot make out the food is prepared without GARLIC. Keep some time on the morning to have Darshanam and classic Lunch.",1
Such a nice & pleasant place. Peaceful,1
"I must say I am not the very religious kind but this place is a must visit. Mind it, this place, in my opinion has also grown to be more like a business center but the ambiance and location is perfect. Do not eat anything in the canteen or buy any stuff from the temple stores as they are not of very high quality and are usually overpriced. For example I bought some sweets for prasadam and I hoped that since they are made in this special place they must be very pure and good. But I found out opposite. Did not get a very good feel. I also tried the breakfast they serve in the canteen, it is not up to the mark, not at all :( However, I must say that the prasadam (free) you get near the exit, is really really good :) I do not really condemn the business model a lot because this money is eventually used for good purposes like Akshay patra program etc (as far as I know). But it would have been really good if the stuff sold here was of really good taste and quality as it would give you a nice feeling inside.",1
"Iskcon temple is a lovely place to visit, even with the crowds all around, standing in queue and passing by in the first queue in front of the God... the feeling is great and the aarti time is marvelous... you almost transition to a different sphere... After the temple visit, rest comes as a shopping complex, a lot many shops (will definitely some of the market streets of Bangalore) and even more eatery outlets, where you get all kind of snacks... Some are good like the ones with the paintings, artifacts depicting various Gods... Other than that... cleanliness is to be improved a bit in the crowded eatery areas (can't blame the temple staff as people from all walks of life visit the place)... http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r318265969-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",0
"Was carried out on a Saturday morning around 10 o'clock, we were able to enter to immediately free. Paying 2 rupees at the entrance deposit the shoes, it goes into barefoot. In the middle of the course and the main hall go up the stairs to the main hall, people of devout Hindus have a prayer, myself you are coming by tourism was quite out of place feeling. Inside the main hall, but is worth of decorations and ceiling paintings are very beautiful at first glance ..., I guess that's it. Excessive expectations is taboo. Not a tourist spot view there until over time. Let's taste the atmosphere of the local Krishna temple. By the way, (it is a little exaggerated and say) dress code there is. I have the will become likely caught, that do not show the shin of the leg regardless of gender. I was wearing a short pants length, but it was me through the last minute. And also to say, in the case of NG if lost to the waist passed the cloth bath towel size, put Could you in. Shoulder can be seen (sleeveless) also, such as it was NG ¬∑¬∑¬∑",0
excellent piece of fine construction. the only drawback is that one has to walk a lot to reach the temple which is difficult for elderly.,1
"They wanted to take our bags off us which had our cameras and passports. We didn't want to do this, so only ended up looking from a distance. It is also conveniently located to orion mall.",0
One of the best and beautiful ISKCON temples in India. Closing dharsan is highly emotional and eye will make you to cry,1
A very well maintained and beautiful temple of Lord Krishna. The main temple is huge and the prayer hall is very calm and peaceful. Very wonderful place and a must visit for anyone who are in/touring Bangalore. Also the food stalls serve a truly vegetarian food (prasad) which is wonderfully tasty.,1
Visiting this place will definitely refresh your mind and the discipline and cleanliness maintained here is awesome.,1
Let Lord be full of mercy upon me & my beloved son Dharmesh.,1
Beautiful temple and the paintings and architecture is very nice. But I seriously doubt why such massive buildings are required for places of worship. I do not donate at such places because most of the money is used is establishing more buildings and bigger temples.,1
"I don't feel like it is a temple. I felt like a ""forced to visit"" supermarket. Too much sales. Even snacks.. And sadly I saw a dialogue written new free food area that ""if you want to avoid war then believe in Krishna"" I have no idea what they means with that..",0
Here there is a true appreciation of Krishna or Govinda or Keshava or Madhava as called in South India. The temple is near Mahalakshmi metro. Near it is the Orion mall. The temple is closed in the afternoon. The restaurant is good and there is a stage where various activities take place. The place looks very South Indian and also the normal devotion of ISKCON.,1
jay jagannath..,1
One of super place in bangalore,1
ISKCON is A Hindu temple under hare rama Hare Krishna trust. The entire place is filled with rama krishna chants. On Weekends the place gets crowded. Archana tickets worth 300/- for six members will allow you to move in a vip queue which moves faster and you get to stand closer to the sanctum sanctorum. You wil get Prasadam after the small bhajna. Many Hindu holy books are available for sale. Also many sweets and other handicrafts are available for sale. Very pleasant way to spend two three hours.,1
Beautiful architecture. The best iskcon temple in India,1

Crowds..& the Hustler attitude of the Shopping Mall attached to the Temple.. ISKCON is really a desperate organisation.. And I was a fool..,0
"ISKCON is famous for its grandeur and beauty wherever it is established. I visited this temple in August last year with my family and had no problem in throughout the 'darshan' process. The entry, queue and darshan is very well managed in and around the temple. The temple is very clean and ofcourse no photos are allowed inside the temple. The visual of the Lord Krishna's idol and the decor is simple amazing and breath taking. After the 'darshan', the queue ends up at commercial stalls lined up to sell prasad/books/clothes/food and accessories. Please check the timings before visiting the temple to avoid standing outside the temple if the gates are closed.",1
One can be enthralled by chanting the hare krishna mantra.,1
"It is very nice temple even though it is commercialized. The deities looks very attractive. You will feel some brightness when you go to the temple. Chanting of Hare Rama Hare Krishna makes you relax.. Maintenance of the temple is very good. Even though it does not give you the authentic old temple feel, it is a nice temple...",1
Great experience....Nice and very clean....Superb atmosphere,1
"I visited with my friends and it was amazing , really had some good time , really had a peace of mind , We were all young guys together but everybody liked it.",1
Beautiful.,1
"Been here a couple of times and had a good experience. Parking easily available for 2 and 4 wheelers at a fair rate. The queue is very organized and photography is not allowed inside the premises but Indian love breaking these rules. Entry is free and you need to deposit ur footwear near entry and can collect it post ur visit. You get to see small Idols on the way before u get to the main shrine . People are always singing and dancing here Hare Rama Hare Krishna and you can sit around if you like and let the atmosphere sink into u. Just before the exit you will find yourself in a huge Hall area where you could buy things like toys, stationery , clothes etc . There are also a lot of food stalls that sell sweets and snacks a must try I would say, the samosa and jalebi are my favorites. Hope u have a good time , Hare Krishna.

Beautiful place to worship Krishna!,1
A Great Masterpiece In Banglore,1
"I have visited this beautiful temple 3-4 times till now. It's a marvelous piece of architecture constructed with white marbles. Because, the temple is located at a small hilltop, the view from the temple to the overlooking road is very pleasant. The atmosphere inside is truly divine and soothes the mind and soul. You can take the blessings of Lord Krishna and know about the Vaishnava culture. There is a book stall from where you can purchase holy books for reading. The temple has a canteen and shopping area where you can feed yourself with a variety of vegetarian food and buy some handicraft material as well. This temple offers everything you look for on a weekend outing. It's peaceful and divine. The only flip side is that the temple remains very crowded during weekends and other festivals. However, looking at the popularity of it, that should be fine.",1
So many temples visited during my trip but this one is so beautiful. System to handel peoples is quite nice here. Iskon shop is also quite good,1
its ossam movement in life to visit ISKCON TEMPLE IN BANGALORE.....this is very interesting place and ossam...everyone wanna visit this place,1
Serene beauty and divine krishna You will feel connection of your soul with that universal source Hare Krishna,1
Peace in the middle of the city.,1
Iskcon temple is a very unique place of lord Radhe Krishna & The temple situated is very Beautiful place .,1
"ISKCON temple in Rajajinagar is a landmark and worth a visit. The temple is a layered temple and starts with a temple dedicated to Lord Narasimha. The middle level has a temple dedicated to Venkateshwara and the final layer has the Sri Krishna temple. The tower above this temple is glass clad and looks beautiful both at daytime and night. Weekends could take more time because of the crowds. Also Arathi is elaborate and good to view, but may be an issue if you are in a hurry. The prasad stalls are wonderful and offer a huge variety of interesting foods. There is also a prasad seva place for a thali lunch (for those who offer special sevas). But I recommend visiting their restaurant ""The Higher Taste"" which has an elaborate buffet and a great la-carte menu. The buffet variety is huge. The food is very easy on the stomach and is also very tasty. The food is totally satvik (no non-veg, garlic, onions etc.), but the variety and interesting presentation ensures that you don't miss these.",1
Super,1
We love this place.,1
Well-maintained. peaceful place to spend time in a noisy city.,1

Good to go once for a visit else only on the days when special Poojas are planned. Check out the special pooja and if atall any kirtans....,0
Good to visit once..highly commercialize and crowded..very clean and excellently manage..it's good for outing....,0
Very good,1
"Heavenly experience in the beginning when you walk on the steps chanting Hare Krishna. Very quiet and disciplined place , need to walk in the queue only. Beautiful darshan of all deities. Need to buy Prasad for the offering. You can spend quality time participating in the prayers. Later while coming back you will find a big market where all religious books and different deities are sold in metal. It is noisy there, sellers will call you sometime to buy the stuff, next is the eating corner where you find all the junk. Food is little expensive comparatively, enjoy eating it while standing.",0
It's so peace in here. It's like heaven itself. It's one of Its kind. It's a must visit temple if you are religious.,1
It is really the place to visit. .... Hare krishana hare Rama. ....,1

"This is located in Yeshwantpur, Bangalore. The temple is a beautiful white structure in a captivating surrounding. The temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna. We visited during the evening hours and attended the aarti. It was great experience to be in the mass aarti session witnessing devotees praying to the Lord, singing the bhajans and dancing. The temple environment was very peaceful. I felt peace in my mind by spending some time in the temple premises.",1

This time I went with few senior citizens in family and opted to take lift service as it wa slate evening on Tuesday, and delighted to see it directly took us in the main temple at top where final Aaarti and Palki yata was about to start, being a weekday not many people were there like weekend , so got enough time and close view of all proceeding, After pooja , we came down by lift , but they have introduced another exit for regular visitors, which does not take through all counters for articles there. we harldy spent any time more than what we spent in temple, it was the time well spend with maximum happiness and satisfcation.",1
It is Heaven not temple,1
Loved it... What a wonderful place,1

I like very much,1
"Like other ISKCON Temples, this place also has a lot of positivist in itself. The Management has done a very decent job in ensuring smooth visit for all the worshipers. The Positive vibes inside helps in meditation and overall positive flow of thoughts. Nice to see the donations are also accepted through Pay TM....Overall nicely maintained. Do check the temple timings before visiting as it is closed for few hours everyday.",1
Good place to eat. Very expensive but not worth money,0
"Went with the family -beautiful temple and lord krishna looks divine and well maintained Has to walk all through lot including need to climb more steps which are bit slippery - there should have special Q for senior citizens and ladies carrying children Also while coming out after darshan , somehow the entire way is filled with stalls (foods items/other ) - there should be some alternate ways for people to come out after darshan without visiting the shops , so that it less congestion",0
Brilliant experience. One must visist this temple considering the warmth and the effection that lord krishna bestows upon. Ones life is connected with this mandir.,1

"Nice well maintained temple. Very systematic.. went there with family. there was no problem finding parking. since it was festival season there was lot of crowd. after standing in queue for about 10-15 min we could reach the main temple hall. There was Deepotsav going on where you can buy small panathi (lamps) and burn them there itself. There are big statues of ram sita in the hall. after you exit the main hall, there are other rooms where lot of books, pictures and other pooja items are placed for display and also available for sale. once you come out of the temple you can collect the prasaad (which usually is pongal) and exit the temple.

"A place where you can feel the personal presence of Lord Krishna. A place filled with spiritual energy. A place where you feel like spending every moment of life. Words are not enough to describe my experiences here. You have to personally visit once, to know what exactly it feels to experience the highest form of divinity.",1
Visited on Sunday evening with family. For sure must place to visit in case you are spiritual. Avoid going on Sun evening as we had to stand in line for more than 30 mins and it's not easy for senior citizens considering that there are many steps as well.,1

"this is a beautiful example of Indian art, culture and Hindu religion. come here to find some inner peace and lovely vegan meals.",1
"Very nice temple and good looking& location,",1
"Maintenance of the temple is excellent, the place is very clean and everything is well organised. After you complete the mandatory security check, you climb the steps to enter into the queue for the darshan.One of the finest and beautiful place in the Hare Krishna world. Metro station is very close to this place. Suggest to visit in weekdays than in weekend due to tourists and local crowd. Don't miss Hanuman temple which is close by this place but the other side of the road.",1
"Nice place to eat out, you've so many options to choose from.",1
Good place to visit at morning If you are a member u will have VIP pass which ensures visit through different channels to worship god which will avoid crowds. Further you can have special break fast which is really delicious really friendly people and good management. Take good photo shots. Can spend time with family.,1
Complete package for family to enjoy evening in Bangalore city. Very good clean and maintained place. Easily accessible.,1

Beautiful temple,1
"ISKCON temple at Bangalore is one of the city's most beautiful temples. It is situated on a hill. If you are there at the time of Aarti, you will enjoy the chants and bhajans that happen at that time. Must visit place in Bangalore once.",1
"I have visited 4 times there...Its a wonderfull spiritual palce..clean and well organized..inside the tample you will get spiritual books, dress, prasad, diiferent types of foods..at the exit point tample provide khichrdi..",1
"Very beautifully built temple. The place is very near to orion mall, hence one can park his car there and then go walking to this place. Siting in the main hall on top is a good place for meditation. weekends may be crowded, hence better to visit on weekdays. The variety of snacks offered at a cost as Prasads are also very good. The house of the Supreme Lord is always open to all to seek his blessings.",1
Very peaceful place in bengaluru. Loved it,1
"Visits every time during bangalore stay, holy place for peace of mind. Will take minimum two hours to see all. Would recommend to seat at the main temple for at least 15 minutes.",1
"I'm not an overtly religious person, and I have my own interpretation of what it means to be religious. Hence it isn't fair for me to review this temple as a religious place. What i can vouch for is that you will feel some positive vibes from the place. Lastly I leave you with an interesting tidbit: The Parappana Agrahara prison in Bangalore is crowded with 4700 inmates, more than twice its capacity, because small-time criminals are refusing to apply for bail, according to the Bangalore Mirror. That's because ISKCON Temple supplies food to the prison. If that isn't enough to make you want to visit, I don't know what is!",1
"This place can get quite crowded over the weekends. But you could skip this should you choose to skip the peak day hours. Once you reach the top most building, and if it is not very crowded, the ambiance is surreal and worth every step you climbed. I strongly recommend not to ""purchase"" any package tours. Shops inside the building tend to overprice goods and is not worth the money.",1
"Very nice and peaceful. They have a dress code for people visiting there. People are not allowed in shorts. For ladies its better if they don't wear sleeveless dresses in temple, if so then you'll have to rent a Dupatta available at the security.",1
Beautiful temple,1
"Iskcon is a place for lord Krishna lovers. You can get peace of mind here by involving yourself in hare Rama hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna hare hare.. this temple has beautiful art of child hood Krishna life .. the golden appearance of Krishna will give you rich sight.",1

Nice place...hare Krishna hare Rama....must visit place in Bangalore....,1
??? what a commercialisation..!!,0
The temple is beautiful and on a height. Make sure you go either early in the morning or later in the evenings when there is less traffic.,0
"Was totally taken aback by the crowd here last weekend! My parents were visiting and had heard a lot about the Iskcon temple in Bangalore so wanted to visit the same. Firstly it was really far away from where we stay and to top it all it was super-crowded when we reached there! There were queues of hundred of people wanting to go in for darshan! Fount the place too commercialized and as a friend said ""like ikea"". Did not feel like a Iskcon temple at all! They had definitely managed the crowds well but i would definitely not go back there ever!",0
first time I visited ISKCON temple in my life. its truly amazing experience and full of adventures there with in a short span. however its really maintained neat & clean and proper sun-light at higher altitude makes this place so crowd in the evening times.,1
A worthwhile place to visit with family. The temple is well planned and ambience is very pleasant The place is neat and tidy. It's better to avoid rush hours otherwise it will take a very long time to complete. The location is well situated and its easily accessible now as there is a metro station nearby. It's worth a visit...,1
"ISKCON temple takes you to a spiritual realm that you can feel nowhere else. There are temples & then there is ISKCON. If you visit Bangalore, make it a point to visit the ISKCON.",1
"Its a good place, you get into religious mood hearing the chanting... But its chaotic when too much crowd and got to move up and down by stairs to pray at different levels.. Inside the main temple totally divine... But I personally did'nt like temple employees asking for VIP darshans to pay... Or again pay for flowers etc offerrings... Though its visitors decision to pay or not... But still it just kills the religious feeling n praying with whole heart... Also the way from main temple to outside gate... Is full of temple employees selling religious books n malas.... So the divine feeling diminishes and one just has to appreciate marketing team efforts to sell these products. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r287800036-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",0

They sing Bhajans everyday.

I had mind relaxed in front of Lord Krishna it's divine place,1
Food inside is average. Its more like a shopping mall of worship. They do not allow cameras outside as well.,0

Pleasant atmosphere which we cannot find any other place..This was my 3rd visit also I'm feeling as a first visit..Every time I visit I feel as my first visit.bcz it's a place I love to be here for my whole life and make seva for the god and people who come to here..#hare Rama hare Rama Rama Rama hare hare #Hare Krishna hare Krishna Krishna Krishna hare hare ??,1
Clean and well maintained Temple.. Coming out of the temple is bit difficult considering the number of people who visit,1
"If you have been to Akshardham temple in Delhi or Gandhi Nagar you will have the same deja vu while visiting Iskcon Bangalore. Its not as huge Akshardham nevertheless the facilities , the discipline of devotees and the maintenance is same Best way to reach is Metro Green Line. Have a station 500 m from Iskcon. You are connected to Majestic , Bangalore City station , Malleswaram and Jayanagar ... So no need to rush through and drive through the city traffic near majestic and city railway station You have a lot of sales activities whether its books , art work or food happening. It may be slightly be irritating as you have to pass through to all finally come out. However its a nice walk and no soliticiation happens. Good to see the stores and all infact Wear something comfortable .. Jeans and T shirt may not be great. But a nice shirt and pant is allowed. They dont look too strict on dress code Have a nice darshan , Meet communities , feel happy !!!",1
It also very nice to me.,1
"Really interesting experience! The ceremonies, leben and worshippers made this into a genuine experience which is certainly recommended!",1
"I went with my family and it was amazing experience. The temple is closed in afternoon, so please confirm the timings before making any plans.",1
"One of the must see place in Bangalore, you get the divine experience all round. Chanting of mantras and serene ambiance makes your experience better. Good clean ambient and a place where you can hang around for good long time for meditation and peace. On your exit to the temple, you are treated with some truly good tasty food cooked by Bengali workers.",1
Cool place,1
"The place is well maintained, managed and you have have ample souvenirs to pick on the way out. Only if the crowd will have more etiquette on behaving and going around in public place the trip could have been great.",1
"This temple is interesting as a large Hare Krishna temple. It is worth a visit, if you are near. Be aware: you need to cover your full legs and shoulders (they have long sarongs available), and cannot take your camera/bags inside. For women bringing a (small) purse is fine. There are a lot of stairs to climb, and in summer the marble floors can be VERY hot.",1
"The ISKCON Temple is certainly a must-do from my point of view. More than the religious significance, the ambience and the restaurant add charm to any visitor. One would be advised to go there when it is quieter (I do not know when!) and less hot as the heat could singe one's soles!!",1
"If you ask i will rate it as an ordinary temple because in the name of god and religion, the temple authority has made a shopping complex of the so nicely built temple.Every path you go through in order to get a glimpse of the divine power,you will see people selling some books,clothers,eatables,photos and what not !! I was shocked to see them making more effort to sell things rather than making it a lifetime experience for people who come from even very far places for once in a lifetime visit to the temple.Personally i found the temple,the architecture and the crowd to be really good and the 3 stars hence, but the management is pathetic.They focus just on making money.",0
The location of the temple. The discipline in the line. The advises on food. The prasad which is sadvik. The serene and quiet atmosphere. The upkeep of the premises. The calmness and peace of mind to us. Visited April 2014,1
The temple which is trying to give the orginal indian vedic culture for every individual in a systematic way especially the chanting the Hare Krishna mantra for the mind control and prosperity.,1
Peace full place to flow placidly away from shrieking crazy traffic woes. And let all your tensions slip away in a blissful place,1
"I went Iskcon temple recently and This visit was after 10 years. I love this place due its dignity and feeling of peace here. I completely agree the temple is modern style and seems it is commercial but if you just keep in mind that you are only considering the good things like ample space, cleanliness and environment. you will love it. Evening and morning view is very nice from temple as it is on high altitude. I will still keep must visit place in Bangalore. you should try to go during Aarti [Prayer] time then you feel how much people having faith in this temple. Security people not necessary understand english then take help of local. Please considerate on dressing as this is religious place and people are having sentiments. Specially for females, temple authority advise them to in formal dress rather than party dresses. This is no hard and fast rule for dressing. Have a nice time in temple!!!",1

"The temple premises are located close to yeshwantpur railway station. The place is impeccably neat and well maintained. There is a usual stream of regular devotees, tourists and locals which frequents the place. Right from the entrance to the main temple area for the ""Darshan"" (Viewing) of the Statues, to the disbursal of ""prasad"" (gracious gift) everything proceeds in a uniquely orderly fashion. Do check the time before visting the place as the gates are closed during afternoons and at some times (don't remember the exact timings, but we had to wait for a bit as we were early) Good experience in general by temple standards.",1

SKCON bangalore is a great place to go. Visited the temple during night time and it was excellent night view. The place was very neat and good maintenance.

Books for sell are also available inside. after Having prasad, we can sit nearby the beautiful fountain.",1
I always like to be in iskcon. Its really my sons krishna n balaram existing place. Hare krishna.,1
"the temple itself is very beautiful and it draws lots of devotees daily. the actual organisation of crowd control and health and safety issues are very well managed. the only downside to this temple is that you cant just go and see the temple and leave. you are directed into the commercial side whether you want to or not. on every corner on your way out there is somebody or another selling stuff, starting from the books to food. I found this quite contradictory to the teachings of the holy book",0
"I visit this temple twice - once on my business trip and during a family tour, both during the evening aarti. The atmosphere is serene, the place is beautifully constructed & decorated. The ambience inside the temple is spiritual with lots of devotees from all over the world. They served the best sweet jaggery prasadam.",1
"The temple gives a positive vibe, the Hare Krishna hill is located in the midst of a garden, pond, mini water falls. There is parking available. The inside of the temple is very mesmerizing. very clean and beautiful. It it amazing during the bhajans and we went during the evening bhajans. this should not be missed!! The prasadam was also very yummy with khara pongal which has been our favourite for many years!",1
Good place if you planning to visit temple for around 2 hrs. On weekends visit could turn into 4 hrs because of excessive crowd.,1
"Nice temple ... Whenever i visit, I feel very peaceful .",1
This place is within the city limits.. hence choosing the time of day is important... we prefer to visit the place on normal days by 11 AM to get an sober darshan.. prasad.. relax time inside the temple.. and then the food in the restaurant (which is free till 1 PM) on regular day. Good for some memorabilia from the shops within the premises... Parking is not a problem.,1
The temple is wonderfully built and maintained. Its blissful experience in the main hall.The food they serve in the food shop is excellent.,1

Wonderful temple,1
I visited ISKON temple after long time (may be 2-3 years gap) and realized that nothing much changed over the time. Gone with spouse taking my 2 years daughter over the bike entered premises and seen for parking they started charging 10 rupees which was not there previously but they have good parking facility so not a issue over parking space. Gone through normal line which takes through tiles where peoples are chanting while placing a foot on tiles. (If you pay more you don't need to chant go can go directly for darshan (which I don't like it really). On the way took fruit basket for offering and I been asked for 300 rupees for different lane which will take people closure to the idols when I refused fruit basket was taken from me and sent me forward (it kept side & doubt it might gone back for sell) but later I got the broken coconut and bananas so no complain about taking fruit basket and keeping aside intact. Going back realized that return path is changed and now return path is all full off marketing and it tempting to buy some items on the way & last stop is eatery. Going out you will be given prasadam (this time it was banana) and just outside there small restaurant where someone have nice meal. its good place to visit and shed some worries (other things I mentioned it was my perspective not everybody will agree for it).,1
This ISKCON is huge beautifully crafted and amazing. Finally a divine peace for a follower like me !!!,1
