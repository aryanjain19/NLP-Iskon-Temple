      "I visited whilst on a River Ganges river cruise. This landmark could be seen from a very long way away and certainly looks, from a distance, as a celebration of something, On arriving, we had a very good local guide who introduced us to all of the buildings and the teaching that was in progress. The temples are fantastic - spectacular, but I have an issue over the use of money. There is still more work to do to complete the structures and they are seeking donations of $35,000,000 over a 4 year period to 2022 - $800,000 per month. There is an awful lot of poverty and need in the world that could benefit from this month, and still represent a celebration of faith. Well worth a visit and best to have a guide in order to understand, or have a pilgrimage and stay in the hostels on site (must give at least 60 days notice of making a booking.\n",
